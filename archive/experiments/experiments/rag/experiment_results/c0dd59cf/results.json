( kass 2003, 10 ) in their pursuit to enhance and even transcend the current human condition, transhumanists cast shadows over the goodness of life while raising hopes for a bright and better future. thus, even if many of its imaginative prospects do not eventuate, it demands a reﬂective response, for our",
