As the narrative unfolds, it appears that\nhumans are not good enough, and there is\nreason-indeed, a moral duty-to enhance\nourselves through the ingenuity of science\nand technology. At the root of this imperative\nfor enhancement is a profound sense of despondency and frustration with our human condition. In this, transhumanists clearly respond to a\nvalid human experience.

As the narrative unfolds, it appears that\nhumans are not good enough, and there is\nreason-indeed, a moral duty-to enhance\nourselves through the ingenuity of science\nand technology. At the root of this imperative\nfor enhancement is a profound sense of despondency and frustration with our human condition. In this, transhumanists clearly respond to a\nvalid human experience.

From these initial aspirations, contemporary proponents of the transhumanist cause,\nencouraged by advances in science and technology, are confident of its realization. But in\ndoing so, they refine Huxley’s end, making a\ndistinction between a transhuman and a posthuman state. The distinction between the two\nis not fixed. Generally speaking, the transhuman (or “transitional” human) is one whose\nphysical,\nintellectual,\npsychological\ncapacities are enhanced with respect to the\npresent human experience, but not to the\npoint of creating a new species. The posthuman, on the other hand, refers to a radically\nnew state characterized by an amplification\nof one’s capacities that would constitute a\nnew kind of being. In seeking to enhance humanity beyond its\nnatural limitations, the transhumanist project\nembraces a wide range of proposals, from\nsimple and achievable measures to the scientifically\ntechnical\nbizarre. between scientific fact and science fiction. light of its more futuristic aspirations, transhumanism might not seem to warrant serious\nreflection. Before the presence of real, existent\nbioethical dilemmas such as new threats to\nlife, the unjust distribution of healthcare\nresources, and the perennial issues surrounding life at its beginning and end, devoting\ntime to an improbable possibility might\nappear to be a distraction or a luxury that we\ncan ill afford. Yet the prospect of transhumanism has caught the imagination of not just a\nfew contemporary bioethicists and philosophers, inspiring centers of research, and sparking a lively debate between its supporters and\ncritics. And this interest seems to only\nincrease. transhumanist ideas have moved from the\nfringes of philosophical inquiry into the\nmainstream. However, beyond the demands of public\ninterest, the transhumanist proposal demands\na response since it touches on the very\nmeaning of human life and hope. In asking\nwhy one should take seriously the proposals\nof transhumanists, American bioethicist Leon\nKass writes:\nIt raises the weightiest questions of bioethics,\ntouching on the ends and goals of the biomedical\nenterprise, the nature and meaning of human\nflourishing, and the intrinsic threat of dehumanization (or the promise of super humaniza tion). compels attention to what it means to be a\nhuman being and to be active as a human\nbeing.",

The difference lies in transhumanism’s desire to engage such technologies\ntoward\nsurpassing\ntherapeutic. Transhumanists seek to enhance the human\ncondition beyond any notion of “normal”\nfunctioning (which, as shall be seen below,\nthey fundamentally deny); to make us, in the\nwords of Michael Sandel, “better than well”\n(Sandel 2009, . In so doing, they purposefully disregard the therapy-enhancement distinction with its presumption of normative\nfunction and render any improvement as an\nenhancement, that is, an “improvement” of a\nperson’s life relative to their former condition. From this perspective, the prospects for\nenhancement are limitless. According to the\nTranshumanist Declaration, first drafted in\n1988, humanity’s potential is still mostly unrealized. Signatories of this declaration envision\nthe possibility of harnessing the human potential to transcend its current form by overcoming aging, cognitive shortcomings, physical\nlimitations, and suffering. To this end, they\nfavor morphological freedom-the right to\nmodify and enhance one’s body, cognition,\nand emotions. This freedom includes the\nright to use techniques and technologies to\nextend life; preserve the self through cryonics,\nuploading, and other means; and to choose\nfurther modifications and enhancements. The term “transhumanism” was first used in\n1957 by Julian Huxley in his book New Bottles\nfor New Wine. Huxley envisaged a transhuman\nstate at the end of an evolutionary process\nguided by science and technology. He conceives of “man remaining man, but transcending himself, by realizing new possibilities of\nand for his human nature” (Huxley 1957,\n. Huxley envisions humanity as the final\nfrontier for exploration.
