Only those who are truly human, who love and appreciate the giftedness of human life, can be trusted to use technology in a way that fosters integral human development. Conclusion Transhumanism, like other contemporary prospects for human enhancement, offers itself as hope for the future; to “relieve” humanity of its limitations (McKenny 1997, through the application of biotechnology. However, as traced in this paper, the philosophical foundations of transhumanism in scientific positivism render it incapable of understanding the human novelty. In its narrow conception of reality, its limitation of meaning to praxis, and its reduction of the human essence to rationality (mind) or materialism (body), it fundamentally changes our anthropology, strips it of normative value, and distorts the essence of our humanity. Its capacity to know what is good for humanity is, therefore, extremely doubtful. Furthermore, through the secularization of hope, characterized by an absolute belief in progress through science and technology, the future of humanity is firmly placed within the hands of biotechnology. With unrestrained confidence in the powers of technology, the transhumanist cause is projected as the “new frontier” of exploration-the aspiration and hope for the future. However, from its origins, such optimistic aspirations are rooted in negativity and frustration over humanity’s current lot. This sense of dissatisfaction for the present human condition-the sense that we are “not good enough”-is the foundation of the transhumanist dream that opens towards a posthuman future. This façade of hope, therefore, can offer no real reassurance. The transhumanist dream, despite its veneer of hope, is in reality a manifestation of a deep despair.

Generally speaking, the transhuman (or “transitional” human) is one whose physical, intellectual, and psychological capacities are enhanced with respect to the present human experience, but not to the point of creating a new species. The posthuman, on the other hand, refers to a radically new state characterized by an amplification of one’s capacities that would constitute a new kind of being. In seeking to enhance humanity beyond its natural limitations, the transhumanist project embraces a wide range of proposals, from simple and achievable measures to the scientifically technical and bizarre. It moves between scientific fact and science fiction. In light of its more futuristic aspirations, transhumanism might not seem to warrant serious reflection. Before the presence of real, existent bioethical dilemmas such as new threats to life, the unjust distribution of healthcare resources, and the perennial issues surrounding life at its beginning and end, devoting time to an improbable possibility might appear to be a distraction or a luxury that we can ill afford. Yet the prospect of transhumanism has caught the imagination of not just a few contemporary bioethicists and philosophers, inspiring centers of research, and sparking a lively debate between its supporters and critics.

In asking why one should take seriously the proposals of transhumanists, American bioethicist Leon Kass writes: It raises the weightiest questions of bioethics, touching on the ends and goals of the biomedical enterprise, the nature and meaning of human flourishing, and the intrinsic threat of dehumanization (or the promise of super humaniza tion).\nBefore the presence of real, existent bioethical dilemmas such as new threats to life, the unjust distribution of healthcare resources, and the perennial issues surrounding life at its beginning and end, devoting time to an improbable possibility might appear to be a distraction or a luxury that we can ill afford.

(Kass 2003, In their pursuit to enhance and even transcend the current human condition, transhumanists cast shadows over the goodness of life while raising hopes for a bright and better future. Thus, even if many of its imaginative prospects do not eventuate, it demands a reflective response, for our hopes and aspirations define who we are. “What we hope for tells us a great deal about who we are,” says Gilbert Meilaender (2013, . Even if the quest for transcending our humanity turns out in the end to be no more than a “pipe dream,” the fact that it is even proposed is significant.

          "text": "The novelty of the transhumanist project does not lie in the biotechnologies that it advances. Many of the technologies proposed are already on-line and used therapeutically. Pharmaceuticals, genetic manipulation, nanotechnology, and some brain-computer interfaces (e.g., cochlear implants for the hearing impaired) already exist in clinical practice and promise further advances to treat and cure disability and disease. The difference lies in transhumanism’s desire to engage such technologies toward ends surpassing the therapeutic. Transhumanists seek to enhance the human condition beyond any notion of “normal” functioning (which, as shall be seen below, they fundamentally deny); to make us, in the words of Michael Sandel, “better than well” (Sandel 2009, . In so doing, they purposefully disregard the therapy-enhancement distinction with its presumption of normative function and render any improvement as an enhancement, that is, an “improvement” of a person’s life relative to their former condition. From this perspective, the prospects for enhancement are limitless. According to the Transhumanist Declaration, first drafted in 1988, humanity’s potential is still mostly unrealized. Signatories of this declaration envision the possibility of harnessing the human potential to transcend its current form by overcoming aging, cognitive shortcomings, physical limitations, and suffering. To this end, they favor morphological freedom-the right to modify and enhance one’s body, cognition, and emotions. This freedom includes the right to use techniques and technologies to extend life; preserve the self through cryonics, uploading, and other means; and to choose further modifications and enhancements. The term “transhumanism” was first used in 1957 by Julian Huxley in his book New Bottles for New Wine. Huxley envisaged a transhuman state at the end of an evolutionary process guided by science and technology. He conceives of “man remaining man, but transcending himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature” (Huxley 1957, . Huxley envisions humanity as the final frontier for exploration. We have pretty well finished the geographical exploration of the earth; we have pushed the scientific exploration of nature, both lifeless and living, to a point at which its main outlines have become clear; but the exploration of human nature and its possibilities has scarcely begun.\nSignatories of this declaration envision the possibility of harnessing the human potential to transcend its current form by overcoming aging, cognitive shortcomings, physical limitations, and suffering.

          "text": "The Object of Transhumanist Hope and its Philosophical Foundations Encouraged by the possibilities of technology, the transhumanist cause is characteristically hopeful. However, the nature of such hope is of a particular kind. In essence it is an immanent, this-worldly hope: what may be described as a “futureoriented ideology” (Burdett and Lorrimar 2019, that aspires to a “brave new world” (à la Julian Huxley’s more famous brother, Aldous). That which was once confided in God or is now firmly placed within the sphere of the human capacity to know and act, and increasingly finds its solace in a rationality that is the product of technical science. This immanentization of hope is rooted in a deeper philosophical ideology, drawing specifically on the Enlightenment’s confidence that human enhancement comes by way of rational knowledge alone, with knowledge itself reduced to positive categories of the verifiable and demonstrable, especially in the fields of science, mathematics, and history (Ratzinger 2004, . In the process, however, critics point out that the object of rationalistic hope is narrowed and the significance of man diminished. As Joseph Ratzinger writes: The criterion of rationality is taken exclusively from the experience of technological production based on science. Rationality is oriented to functionality, to effectiveness, and to an increase in the quality of life for all. This entails a use- indeed a domination-of nature that is problematic in view of the dramatic environmental problems our world now faces. But man’s domination of his own self nonchalantly takes ever greater steps toward the realization of Aldous Huxley’s vision. Man is no longer to be born in an irrational manner but is to be produced rationally. Man as a product is subject to the control of man. Imperfect individuals must be weeded out; the path of planning and production must aim at the perfect man. Suffering must disappear, and life is to consist of pleasure alone. (Ratzinger 2006, In Ratzinger’s analysis, the reduction of hope to rational, technical science has immediate and negative consequences for anthropology. The relevance of his analysis to the transhumanist cause seems quite clear, with its projection of hope onto biotechnology and its quest to recreate human beings. The Anthropological Question The nature of transhumanist hope is thus rooted in its materialistic and evolutionary anthropology.\nAs Joseph Ratzinger writes: The criterion of rationality is taken exclusively from the experience of technological production based on science.

The Anthropological Question The nature of transhumanist hope is thus rooted in its materialistic and evolutionary anthropology. Emerging from its roots in Enlightenment rationalism, and heir to an evolutionary philosophy, transhumanism holds to the conviction that human beings in their current form are incomplete but improvable; “a work-in-progress, a half-baked being that we can learn to remold in desirable ways” (Bostrom 2003, . They consider human enhancement to be in continuity with evolution, either by giving it a helping hand or by correcting its shortcomings, to move human beings further along evolution’s trajectory by replacing natural selection with technological enhancement. However, while transhumanism finds its rationale in the evolutionary process, it assumes a novel stance in relation to the end of evolution, and its concept of the human person is somewhat removed from the humanist anthropology which originally guided evolutionary theory. The difference lies in the human person’s relation to, or distinction from, Nature. Italian philosopher Maurizio Faggioni (2009, ) explains that while classical evolutionary theory regards human beings as “the point of arrival and the apex of an ascending movement,” transhumanists have purged evolution of its anthropocentr ism and has robbed humanity of any special significance.",

In the end, he insists that positivism is incapable of extinguishing belief, that it cannot annihilate the human search for meaning and the yearning for transcendence, because faith, in its seeking for understanding, corresponds to the truth of human nature. A Deep Despair Philosophically restricted to positive categories, transhumanism is incapable of grasping the depths of the human person. While not hesitating in his acknowledgement that, as a scientific method, positivism “is unbelievably useful and absolutely necessary for the mastery of the problems of ever-developing humanity,” Ratzinger insists that “as a philosophy of life [it] is intolerable and the end of humanity” (Ratzinger 2009, ; that it “is adequate in the technical domain,” but that when it is universalized it “mutilates man” (Ratzinger 2005, . As symptomatic of this “mutilation,” transhumanism radically underestimates the human person’s capacity for spiritual transcendence. It is, therefore, incapable of grasping the goods of man, nor of comprehending the sublime object of his hope. Informed by a negative anthropology, it values human life so little that it is willing to gamble away its uniqueness, surrendering humanity to the whims of technology on the chance that it might be enhanced. Whether flowing from callous disregard, unfounded optimism or dark despair, it would seem madness to allow technological power to be wielded by those who possess such a negative conception of human nature. Hans Jonas makes a similar point. In response to the charge of pessimism over his caution of the destructive power of technology, he suggests that “the greater pessimism is on the side of those who consider the given to be so bad or worthless that every gamble for its possible improvement is defensible” (Jonas 1985, . In other words, those who consider the human condition so lightly as to risk everything should not be trusted with its future.

Only those who are truly human, who love and appreciate the giftedness of human life, can be trusted to use technology in a way that fosters integral human development. Conclusion Transhumanism, like other contemporary prospects for human enhancement, offers itself as hope for the future; to “relieve” humanity of its limitations (McKenny 1997, through the application of biotechnology. However, as traced in this paper, the philosophical foundations of transhumanism in scientific positivism render it incapable of understanding the human novelty. In its narrow conception of reality, its limitation of meaning to praxis, and its reduction of the human essence to rationality (mind) or materialism (body), it fundamentally changes our anthropology, strips it of normative value, and distorts the essence of our humanity. Its capacity to know what is good for humanity is, therefore, extremely doubtful. Furthermore, through the secularization of hope, characterized by an absolute belief in progress through science and technology, the future of humanity is firmly placed within the hands of biotechnology. With unrestrained confidence in the powers of technology, the transhumanist cause is projected as the “new frontier” of exploration-the aspiration and hope for the future. However, from its origins, such optimistic aspirations are rooted in negativity and frustration over humanity’s current lot. This sense of dissatisfaction for the present human condition-the sense that we are “not good enough”-is the foundation of the transhumanist dream that opens towards a posthuman future. This façade of hope, therefore, can offer no real reassurance. The transhumanist dream, despite its veneer of hope, is in reality a manifestation of a deep despair.

Corby, STD, STL, BTheol Hons., MBBS Hons.1 Abstract This paper sets forth some philosophical foundations of the transhumanist project, drawing on its roots in philosophical positivism and its confidence in the liberating power of technology. Such confidence is interpreted within the sphere of hope, departing from transhumanism’s negative presumptions regarding the human condition, and embracing its aspirations for a humanity without limits. However, it is the claim of this paper that such hope is deceptive. Since transhumanism is incapable of grasping the depths of the human person, limited by its own philosophical categories, it both underestimates the human capacity for interior transformation and misunderstands the real nature of hope. Thus, transhumanism is marked by a deeply rooted despair that wears the mask of an insufficient hope.

In the end, he insists that positivism is incapable of extinguishing belief, that it cannot annihilate the human search for meaning and the yearning for transcendence, because faith, in its seeking for understanding, corresponds to the truth of human nature. A Deep Despair Philosophically restricted to positive categories, transhumanism is incapable of grasping the depths of the human person. While not hesitating in his acknowledgement that, as a scientific method, positivism “is unbelievably useful and absolutely necessary for the mastery of the problems of ever-developing humanity,” Ratzinger insists that “as a philosophy of life [it] is intolerable and the end of humanity” (Ratzinger 2009, ; that it “is adequate in the technical domain,” but that when it is universalized it “mutilates man” (Ratzinger 2005, . As symptomatic of this “mutilation,” transhumanism radically underestimates the human person’s capacity for spiritual transcendence. It is, therefore, incapable of grasping the goods of man, nor of comprehending the sublime object of his hope. Informed by a negative anthropology, it values human life so little that it is willing to gamble away its uniqueness, surrendering humanity to the whims of technology on the chance that it might be enhanced. Whether flowing from callous disregard, unfounded optimism or dark despair, it would seem madness to allow technological power to be wielded by those who possess such a negative conception of human nature. Hans Jonas makes a similar point. In response to the charge of pessimism over his caution of the destructive power of technology, he suggests that “the greater pessimism is on the side of those who consider the given to be so bad or worthless that every gamble for its possible improvement is defensible” (Jonas 1985, . In other words, those who consider the human condition so lightly as to risk everything should not be trusted with its future. Transhumanists, with their negative attitude toward the given, should be the last to offer counsel on what is good for the future of humanity.\nAs symptomatic of this “mutilation,” transhumanism radically underestimates the human person’s capacity for spiritual transcendence.

          "text": "The Object of Transhumanist Hope and its Philosophical Foundations Encouraged by the possibilities of technology, the transhumanist cause is characteristically hopeful. However, the nature of such hope is of a particular kind. In essence it is an immanent, this-worldly hope: what may be described as a “futureoriented ideology” (Burdett and Lorrimar 2019, that aspires to a “brave new world” (à la Julian Huxley’s more famous brother, Aldous). That which was once confided in God or is now firmly placed within the sphere of the human capacity to know and act, and increasingly finds its solace in a rationality that is the product of technical science. This immanentization of hope is rooted in a deeper philosophical ideology, drawing specifically on the Enlightenment’s confidence that human enhancement comes by way of rational knowledge alone, with knowledge itself reduced to positive categories of the verifiable and demonstrable, especially in the fields of science, mathematics, and history (Ratzinger 2004, . In the process, however, critics point out that the object of rationalistic hope is narrowed and the significance of man diminished. As Joseph Ratzinger writes: The criterion of rationality is taken exclusively from the experience of technological production based on science. Rationality is oriented to functionality, to effectiveness, and to an increase in the quality of life for all. This entails a use- indeed a domination-of nature that is problematic in view of the dramatic environmental problems our world now faces. But man’s domination of his own self nonchalantly takes ever greater steps toward the realization of Aldous Huxley’s vision. Man is no longer to be born in an irrational manner but is to be produced rationally. Man as a product is subject to the control of man. Imperfect individuals must be weeded out; the path of planning and production must aim at the perfect man. Suffering must disappear, and life is to consist of pleasure alone. (Ratzinger 2006, In Ratzinger’s analysis, the reduction of hope to rational, technical science has immediate and negative consequences for anthropology. The relevance of his analysis to the transhumanist cause seems quite clear, with its projection of hope onto biotechnology and its quest to recreate human beings. The Anthropological Question The nature of transhumanist hope is thus rooted in its materialistic and evolutionary anthropology.\nAs Joseph Ratzinger writes: The criterion of rationality is taken exclusively from the experience of technological production based on science.

The Anthropological Question The nature of transhumanist hope is thus rooted in its materialistic and evolutionary anthropology. Emerging from its roots in Enlightenment rationalism, and heir to an evolutionary philosophy, transhumanism holds to the conviction that human beings in their current form are incomplete but improvable; “a work-in-progress, a half-baked being that we can learn to remold in desirable ways” (Bostrom 2003, . They consider human enhancement to be in continuity with evolution, either by giving it a helping hand or by correcting its shortcomings, to move human beings further along evolution’s trajectory by replacing natural selection with technological enhancement. However, while transhumanism finds its rationale in the evolutionary process, it assumes a novel stance in relation to the end of evolution, and its concept of the human person is somewhat removed from the humanist anthropology which originally guided evolutionary theory. The difference lies in the human person’s relation to, or distinction from, Nature. Italian philosopher Maurizio Faggioni (2009, ) explains that while classical evolutionary theory regards human beings as “the point of arrival and the apex of an ascending movement,” transhumanists have purged evolution of its anthropocentr ism and has robbed humanity of any special significance.",

It is, therefore, incapable of grasping the goods of man, nor of comprehending the sublime object of his hope. Informed by a negative anthropology, it values human life so little that it is willing to gamble away its uniqueness, surrendering humanity to the whims of technology on the chance that it might be enhanced. Whether flowing from callous disregard, unfounded optimism or dark despair, it would seem madness to allow technological power to be wielded by those who possess such a negative conception of human nature. Hans Jonas makes a similar point. In response to the charge of pessimism over his caution of the destructive power of technology, he suggests that “the greater pessimism is on the side of those who consider the given to be so bad or worthless that every gamble for its possible improvement is defensible” (Jonas 1985, . In other words, those who consider the human condition so lightly as to risk everything should not be trusted with its future. Transhumanists, with their negative attitude toward the given, should be the last to offer counsel on what is good for the future of humanity. Only those who are truly human, who love and appreciate the giftedness of human life, can be trusted to use technology in a way that fosters integral human development. Conclusion Transhumanism, like other contemporary prospects for human enhancement, offers itself as hope for the future; to “relieve” humanity of its limitations (McKenny 1997, through the application of biotechnology. However, as traced in this paper, the philosophical foundations of transhumanism in scientific positivism render it incapable of understanding the human novelty. In its narrow conception of reality, its limitation of meaning to praxis, and its reduction of the human essence to rationality (mind) or materialism (body), it fundamentally changes our anthropology, strips it of normative value, and distorts the essence of our humanity. Its capacity to know what is good for humanity is, therefore, extremely doubtful. Furthermore, through the secularization of hope, characterized by an absolute belief in progress through science and technology, the future of humanity is firmly placed within the hands of biotechnology.\nTranshumanists, with their negative attitude toward the given, should be the last to offer counsel on what is good for the future of humanity.

With unrestrained confidence in the powers of technology, the transhumanist cause is projected as the “new frontier” of exploration-the aspiration and hope for the future. However, from its origins, such optimistic aspirations are rooted in negativity and frustration over humanity’s current lot. This sense of dissatisfaction for the present human condition-the sense that we are “not good enough”-is the foundation of the transhumanist dream that opens towards a posthuman future. This façade of hope, therefore, can offer no real reassurance. The transhumanist dream, despite its veneer of hope, is in reality a manifestation of a deep despair.

          "text": "An Innate Despair: The Philosophical Limitations of Transhumanism and its Misplaced Hope in Human Enhancement Paschal M. Corby, STD, STL, BTheol Hons., MBBS Hons.1 Abstract This paper sets forth some philosophical foundations of the transhumanist project, drawing on its roots in philosophical positivism and its confidence in the liberating power of technology. Such confidence is interpreted within the sphere of hope, departing from transhumanism’s negative presumptions regarding the human condition, and embracing its aspirations for a humanity without limits. However, it is the claim of this paper that such hope is deceptive. Since transhumanism is incapable of grasping the depths of the human person, limited by its own philosophical categories, it both underestimates the human capacity for interior transformation and misunderstands the real nature of hope. Thus, transhumanism is marked by a deeply rooted despair that wears the mask of an insufficient hope.

From these initial aspirations, contemporary proponents of the transhumanist cause, encouraged by advances in science and technology, are confident of its realization. But in doing so, they refine Huxley’s end, making a distinction between a transhuman and a posthuman state. The distinction between the two is not fixed. Generally speaking, the transhuman (or “transitional” human) is one whose physical, intellectual, and psychological capacities are enhanced with respect to the present human experience, but not to the point of creating a new species. The posthuman, on the other hand, refers to a radically new state characterized by an amplification of one’s capacities that would constitute a new kind of being. In seeking to enhance humanity beyond its natural limitations, the transhumanist project embraces a wide range of proposals, from simple and achievable measures to the scientifically technical and bizarre. It moves between scientific fact and science fiction. In light of its more futuristic aspirations, transhumanism might not seem to warrant serious reflection. Before the presence of real, existent bioethical dilemmas such as new threats to life, the unjust distribution of healthcare resources, and the perennial issues surrounding life at its beginning and end, devoting time to an improbable possibility might appear to be a distraction or a luxury that we can ill afford. Yet the prospect of transhumanism has caught the imagination of not just a few contemporary bioethicists and philosophers, inspiring centers of research, and sparking a lively debate between its supporters and critics. And this interest seems to only increase. In a short space of time, transhumanist ideas have moved from the fringes of philosophical inquiry into the mainstream. However, beyond the demands of public interest, the transhumanist proposal demands a response since it touches on the very meaning of human life and hope. In asking why one should take seriously the proposals of transhumanists, American bioethicist Leon Kass writes: It raises the weightiest questions of bioethics, touching on the ends and goals of the biomedical enterprise, the nature and meaning of human flourishing, and the intrinsic threat of dehumanization (or the promise of super humaniza tion).\nBefore the presence of real, existent bioethical dilemmas such as new threats to life, the unjust distribution of healthcare resources, and the perennial issues surrounding life at its beginning and end, devoting time to an improbable possibility might appear to be a distraction or a luxury that we can ill afford.

(Kass 2003, In their pursuit to enhance and even transcend the current human condition, transhumanists cast shadows over the goodness of life while raising hopes for a bright and better future. Thus, even if many of its imaginative prospects do not eventuate, it demands a reflective response, for our hopes and aspirations define who we are. “What we hope for tells us a great deal about who we are,” says Gilbert Meilaender (2013, . Even if the quest for transcending our humanity turns out in the end to be no more than a “pipe dream,” the fact that it is even proposed is significant. The Object of Transhumanist Hope and its Philosophical Foundations Encouraged by the possibilities of technology, the transhumanist cause is characteristically hopeful.
