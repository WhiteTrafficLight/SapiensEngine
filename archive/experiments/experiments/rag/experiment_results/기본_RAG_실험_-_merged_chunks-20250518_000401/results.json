Only those who are truly human, who love and appreciate the giftedness of human life, can be trusted to use technology in a way that fosters integral human development. Conclusion Transhumanism, like other contemporary prospects for human enhancement, offers itself as hope for the future; to “relieve” humanity of its limitations (McKenny 1997, through the application of biotechnology. However, as traced in this paper, the philo- sophical foundations of transhumanism in sci- entific positivism render it incapable of understanding the human novelty. In its narrow conception of reality, its limitation of meaning to praxis, and its reduction of the human essence to rationality (mind) or materi- , it fundamentally changes our anthropology, strips it of normative value, and distorts the essence of our humanity. Its capacity to know what is good for humanity is, therefore, extremely doubtful. Furthermore, through the secularization of hope, characterized by an absolute belief in progress through science and technology, the future of humanity is firmly placed within the hands of biotechnology. With unrestrained confidence in the powers of technology, the transhumanist cause is projected as the “new frontier” of exploration-the aspiration and hope for the future. However, from its origins, such optimistic aspirations are rooted in negativity and frustration over humanity’s current lot. This sense of dissatisfaction for the present human condition-the sense that we are “not good enough”-is the foundation of the transhumanist dream that opens towards a posthuman future. This façade of hope, therefore, can offer no real reassurance. The transhumanist dream, despite its veneer of hope, is in reality a manifestation of a deep despair.

The Object of Transhumanist Hope and its Philosophical Foundations Encouraged by the possibilities of technology, the transhumanist cause is characteristically hopeful. However, the nature of such hope is of a particular kind. In essence it is an imma- nent, this-worldly hope: what may be described as a “future-oriented ideology” (Burdett and Lorrimar 2019, that aspires to a “brave new world” (à la Julian Huxley’s more famous brother, Aldous). That which was once confided in God or is now firmly placed within the sphere of the human capacity to know and act, and increasingly finds its solace in a ratio- nality that is the product of technical science. This immanentization of hope is rooted in a deeper philosophical ideology, drawing spe- cifically on the Enlightenment’s confidence that human enhancement comes by way of rational knowledge alone, with knowledge itself reduced to positive categories of the ver- ifiable and demonstrable, especially in the fields of science, mathematics, and history (Ratzinger 2004, . In the process, however, critics point out that the object of rationalistic hope is narrowed and the significance of man diminished. As Joseph Ratzinger writes: The criterion of rationality is taken exclusively from the experience of technological production based on science. Rationality is oriented to func- tionality, to effectiveness, and to an increase in the quality of life for all. This entails a use- indeed a domination-of nature that is problem- atic in view of the dramatic environmental prob- lems our world now faces. But man’s domination of his own self nonchalantly takes ever greater steps toward the realization of Aldous Huxley’s vision. Man is no longer to be born in an irrational manner but is to be produced rationally. Man as a product is subject to the control of man.\nThis immanentization of hope is rooted in a deeper philosophical ideology, drawing spe- cifically on the Enlightenment’s confidence that human enhancement comes by way of rational knowledge alone, with knowledge itself reduced to positive categories of the ver- ifiable and demonstrable, especially in the fields of science, mathematics, and history (Ratzinger 2004, .

Imperfect individuals must be weeded out; the path of plan- ning and production must aim at the perfect man. Suffering must disappear, and life is to consist of pleasure alone. (Ratzinger 2006, In Ratzinger’s analysis, the reduction of hope to rational, technical science has immediate and negative consequences for anthropology. The relevance of his analysis to the transhu- manist cause seems quite clear, with its projec- tion of hope onto biotechnology and its quest to re-create human beings. The Anthropological Question The nature of transhumanist hope is thus rooted in its materialistic and evolutionary anthropology. Emerging from its roots in Enlightenment rationalism, and heir to an evo- lutionary philosophy, transhumanism holds to the conviction that human beings in their current form are incomplete but improvable; “a work-in-progress, a half-baked being that we can learn to remold in desirable ways” (Bostrom 2003, . They consider human enhancement to be in continuity with evolu- tion, either by giving it a helping hand or by correcting its shortcomings, to move human beings further along evolution’s trajectory by replacing natural selection with technological enhancement.",

          "text": "From this perspective, the prospects for enhancement are limitless. According to the Transhumanist Declaration, first drafted in 1988, humanity’s potential is still mostly unre- alized. Signatories of this declaration envision the possibility of harnessing the human poten- tial to transcend its current form by overcom- ing aging, cognitive shortcomings, physical limitations, and suffering. To this end, they favor morphological freedom-the right to modify and enhance one’s body, cognition, and emotions. This freedom includes the right to use techniques and technologies to extend life; preserve the self through cryonics, uploading, and other means; and to choose further modifications and enhancements. The term “transhumanism” was first used in 1957 by Julian Huxley in his book New Bottles for New Wine. Huxley envisaged a transhuman state at the end of an evolutionary process guided by science and technology. He con- ceives of “man remaining man, but transcend- ing himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature” (Huxley 1957, . Huxley envisions humanity as the final frontier for exploration. We have pretty well finished the geographical exploration of the earth; we have pushed the sci- entific exploration of nature, both lifeless and living, to a point at which its main outlines have become clear; but the exploration of human nature and its possibilities has scarcely begun. A vast New World of uncharted possibil- ities awaits its Columbus (Huxley 1957, . From these initial aspirations, contempo- rary proponents of the transhumanist cause, encouraged by advances in science and tech- nology, are confident of its realization. But in doing so, they refine Huxley’s end, making a distinction between a transhuman and a post- human state. The distinction between the two is not fixed. Generally speaking, the transhu- man (or “transitional” human) is one whose physical, intellectual, and psychological capacities are enhanced with respect to the present human experience, but not to the point of creating a new species. The posthu- man, on the other hand, refers to a radically new state characterized by an amplification of one’s capacities that would constitute a new kind of being.\nHuxley envisions humanity as the final frontier for exploration.

In seeking to enhance humanity beyond its natural limitations, the transhumanist project embraces a wide range of proposals, from simple and achievable measures to the scien- tifically technical and bizarre. It moves between scientific fact and science fiction. In light of its more futuristic aspirations, transhu- manism might not seem to warrant serious reflection. Before the presence of real, existent bioethical dilemmas such as new threats to life, the unjust distribution of healthcare resources, and the perennial issues surround- ing life at its beginning and end, devoting time to an improbable possibility might appear to be a distraction or a luxury that we can ill afford. Yet the prospect of transhuman- ism has caught the imagination of not just a few contemporary bioethicists and philoso- phers, inspiring centers of research, and spark- ing a lively debate between its supporters and critics.

In the end, he insists that positivism is incapable of extin- guishing belief, that it cannot annihilate the human search for meaning and the yearning for transcendence, because faith, in its seeking for understanding, corresponds to the truth of human nature. A Deep Despair Philosophically restricted to positive catego- ries, transhumanism is incapable of grasping the depths of the human person. While not hes- itating in his acknowledgement that, as a sci- entific method, positivism “is unbelievably useful and absolutely necessary for the mastery of the problems of ever-developing humanity,” Ratzinger insists that “as a philos- ophy of life [it] is intolerable and the end of humanity” (Ratzinger 2009, ; that it “is adequate in the technical domain,” but that when it is universalized it “mutilates man” (Ratzinger 2005, . As symptomatic of this “mutilation,” trans- humanism radically underestimates the human person’s capacity for spiritual transcendence. It is, therefore, incapable of grasping the goods of man, nor of comprehending the sublime object of his hope. Informed by a neg- ative anthropology, it values human life so little that it is willing to gamble away its uniqueness, surrendering humanity to the whims of technology on the chance that it might be enhanced. Whether flowing from callous disregard, unfounded optimism or dark despair, it would seem madness to allow technological power to be wielded by those who possess such a negative conception of human nature. Hans Jonas makes a similar point. In response to the charge of pessimism over his caution of the destructive power of technology, he suggests that “the greater pessi- mism is on the side of those who consider the given to be so bad or worthless that every gamble for its possible improvement is defen- sible” (Jonas 1985, .

Whether flowing from callous disregard, unfounded optimism or dark despair, it would seem madness to allow technological power to be wielded by those who possess such a negative conception of human nature. Hans Jonas makes a similar point. In response to the charge of pessimism over his caution of the destructive power of technology, he suggests that “the greater pessi- mism is on the side of those who consider the given to be so bad or worthless that every gamble for its possible improvement is defen- sible” (Jonas 1985, . In other words, those who consider the human condition so lightly as to risk everything should not be trusted with its future. Transhumanists, with their neg- ative attitude toward the given, should be the last to offer counsel on what is good for the future of humanity. Only those who are truly human, who love and appreciate the giftedness of human life, can be trusted to use technology in a way that fosters integral human development.

Transhumanism can be defined as a project of enhancement through the application of biotechnology to move human beings beyond their natural limitations: to make them smarter and stronger; to assist them to be happier and morally responsible; and/or to enable them to live longer.

Corby, STD, STL, BTheol Hons., MBBS Hons.1 Abstract This paper sets forth some philosophical foundations of the transhumanist project, drawing on its roots in philosophical positivism and its confidence in the liberating power of technology. Such confidence is interpreted within the sphere of hope, departing from transhumanism’s negative presumptions regarding the human condition, and embracing its aspirations for a humanity with- out limits. However, it is the claim of this paper that such hope is deceptive. Since transhumanism is incapable of grasping the depths of the human person, limited by its own philosophical catego- ries, it both underestimates the human capacity for interior transformation and misunderstands the real nature of hope. Thus, transhumanism is marked by a deeply rooted despair that wears the mask of an insufficient hope.

However, beyond the demands of public interest, the transhumanist proposal demands a response since it touches on the very meaning of human life and hope. In asking why one should take seriously the proposals of transhumanists, American bioethicist Leon Kass writes: It raises the weightiest questions of bioethics, touching on the ends and goals of the biomedical enterprise, the nature and meaning of human flourishing, and the intrinsic threat of dehuman- ization (or the promise of super humaniza tion). It compels attention to what it means to be a human being and to be active as a human being. (Kass 2003, In their pursuit to enhance and even transcend the current human condition, transhumanists cast shadows over the goodness of life while raising hopes for a bright and better future. Thus, even if many of its imaginative pros- pects do not eventuate, it demands a reflective response, for our hopes and aspirations define who we are. “What we hope for tells us a great deal about who we are,” says Gilbert Meilaender (2013, .",

Pharmaceuticals, genetic manipulation, nanotechnology, and some brain-computer interfaces (e.g., cochlear implants for the hearing impaired) already exist in clinical practice and promise further advances to treat and cure disability and disease. The difference lies in transhuman- ism’s desire to engage such technologies toward ends surpassing the therapeutic. Transhumanists seek to enhance the human condition beyond any notion of “normal” functioning (which, as shall be seen below, they fundamentally deny); to make us, in the words of Michael Sandel, “better than well” (Sandel 2009, . In so doing, they purpose- fully disregard the therapy-enhancement dis- tinction with its presumption of normative function and render any improvement as an enhancement, that is, an “improvement” of a person’s life relative to their former condition.

At the root of this imperative for enhancement is a profound sense of despond- ency and frustration with our human condition. In this, transhumanists clearly respond to a valid human experience. Discontentment and disappointment are part of every life. Before our limitations, we all yearn for something more, desire to go further, strive to improve our- selves in one way or another. The human spirit has always striven towards self-improvement, and the historical advances in human culture would be unthinkable without this drive towards enhancement. The real question, however, is whether transhumanists like Savulescu and Bostrom interpret the experience of human dissatisfaction correctly, and whether their confidence in the methods of human enhancement, especially through biotechnology, corresponds to genuine human hope or masks an underlying despair. Transhumanism can be defined as a project of enhancement through the application of biotechnology to move human beings beyond their natural limitations: to make them smarter and stronger; to assist them to be happier and morally responsible; and/or to enable them to live longer. The novelty of the transhumanist project does not lie in the biotechnologies that it advances. Many of the technologies proposed are already on-line and used therapeutically.",

          "text": "Huxley envisions humanity as the final frontier for exploration. We have pretty well finished the geographical exploration of the earth; we have pushed the sci- entific exploration of nature, both lifeless and living, to a point at which its main outlines have become clear; but the exploration of human nature and its possibilities has scarcely begun. A vast New World of uncharted possibil- ities awaits its Columbus (Huxley 1957, . From these initial aspirations, contempo- rary proponents of the transhumanist cause, encouraged by advances in science and tech- nology, are confident of its realization. But in doing so, they refine Huxley’s end, making a distinction between a transhuman and a post- human state. The distinction between the two is not fixed. Generally speaking, the transhu- man (or “transitional” human) is one whose physical, intellectual, and psychological capacities are enhanced with respect to the present human experience, but not to the point of creating a new species. The posthu- man, on the other hand, refers to a radically new state characterized by an amplification of one’s capacities that would constitute a new kind of being. In seeking to enhance humanity beyond its natural limitations, the transhumanist project embraces a wide range of proposals, from simple and achievable measures to the scien- tifically technical and bizarre. It moves between scientific fact and science fiction. In light of its more futuristic aspirations, transhu- manism might not seem to warrant serious reflection. Before the presence of real, existent bioethical dilemmas such as new threats to life, the unjust distribution of healthcare resources, and the perennial issues surround- ing life at its beginning and end, devoting time to an improbable possibility might appear to be a distraction or a luxury that we can ill afford. Yet the prospect of transhuman- ism has caught the imagination of not just a few contemporary bioethicists and philoso- phers, inspiring centers of research, and spark- ing a lively debate between its supporters and critics. And this interest seems to only increase. In a short space of time, transhumanist ideas have moved from the fringes of philosophical inquiry into the mainstream.",

          "text": "An Innate Despair: The Philosophical Limitations of Transhumanism and its Misplaced Hope in Human Enhancement Paschal M. Corby, STD, STL, BTheol Hons., MBBS Hons.1 Abstract This paper sets forth some philosophical foundations of the transhumanist project, drawing on its roots in philosophical positivism and its confidence in the liberating power of technology. Such confidence is interpreted within the sphere of hope, departing from transhumanism’s negative presumptions regarding the human condition, and embracing its aspirations for a humanity with- out limits. However, it is the claim of this paper that such hope is deceptive. Since transhumanism is incapable of grasping the depths of the human person, limited by its own philosophical catego- ries, it both underestimates the human capacity for interior transformation and misunderstands the real nature of hope. Thus, transhumanism is marked by a deeply rooted despair that wears the mask of an insufficient hope. Keywords anthropology, despair, enhancement, hope, philosophical positivism, transhumanism Introduction Much has been written about transhumanism over the past twenty years, such that it is diffi- cult to add anything new to the debate. This present paper does not presume to be novel in this regard. Instead, its main purpose is to draw out the philosophical foundations of the transhumanist project, setting forth its roots in philosophical positivism and its confidence in the liberating power of technology, and to consider the implications for anthropology, the determination of human purpose, and object of human hope. In this regard, it may provide a platform to critique other contempo- rary prospects of “enhancement” that share transhumanist tendencies, such as artificial intelligence and Neuralink, gender fluidity, as well as attempts at hybridization through 1 University of Notre Dame Australia (Sydney Campus), Chippendale, NSW, Australia , , BTheol Hons. , MBBS Hons. .
