Let’s take a healthy look at the popular fruit with registered dietitian Elyse Rottinger, RD, LD. So what do you get when you peel and eat a banana? A medium-sized ripe banana (7 to 8 inches long) contains: A list of vitamins and nutrients is nice, but it can be more important to know what all that good stuff does for your body. Here’s some of what bananas offer. Being ahigher-fiber foodmakes bananas fabulous for digestion and overall gut health. Bananas contain bothinsoluble and soluble fiberto keep your bowel movements regular while boosting your gut’s microbiome. “It’s a food that can help keep things moving in your intestines,” says Rottinger. The fruit is also gentle on your gastrointestinal tract, making it a star in theBRAT dietthat’s a go-to for easing a queasy stomach. (The B in BRAT stands for banana.) Eating bananas can help keep your blood pressure (BP) managed. The reason? Potassium. Potassium works to lower blood pressureby helping your body get rid ofsodium(which, as we all know, can drive your BP higher). Potassium also eases tension on blood vessel walls to help reduce blood pressure. The American Heart Association recommends eating bananas and other potassium-rich foods to managehigh blood pressure(hypertension) and lower your risk ofheart attackandstroke. The vitamin C packed in a banana can boost your immune system’s ability to fight illness, notes Rottinger. Vitamin C is anantioxidantthat neutralizes free radicals before they cause cellular chaos in your body. Dopamineis also found in bananas. In addition to impacting your mood, it acts as an antioxidant that protects against inflammation. “Bananas are rich in important nutrients and antioxidants,” says Rottinger. “Including them regularly in a healthy diet is one of the best ways to reduce inflammation and support your immune system.” When you eat a banana, your belly will feel full for longer thanks to the dietary fiber in the fruit, says Rottinger. Keeping thosehunger pangsat bay can keep you from making less-than-healthy snack choices between meals that can result in extra pounds. “It’s a great idea to pair bananas with a high protein food to keep you even more satisfied,” she recommends. “Top Greek yogurt with banana slices or spread nut butter on slices for a delicious snack.” Bananas may qualify as a performance-enhancing fruit.Research showsthat bananas can mimic sports drinks in how they fuel athletes to improve performance and aid post-workout recovery. Some of that is due to the potassium and magnesium in bananas, explains Rottinger. Both areelectrolytesthat help your heart, muscles, brain and nerves function. “The high amount of vitamin B6 in bananas also helps your body produce energy, making them a smart snack to have before a workout,” she adds. Bananas can help level out your blood sugar IF you eat them at the right time. (Hence, the asterisk.) That’s because the sugar content in a banana varies depending on its ripeness. Green (or unripe) bananas are high inresistant starch, a type of fiber your body can’t digest. Resistant starch helps steady blood sugar by slowing the release of glucose (sugar) into your blood. But as bananas ripen, that resistant starch changes to sugar that digests more quickly and causes a spike in blood sugar. “I often hear people say they avoid bananas since they’ve heard the fruit is too high in sugar,” shares Rottinger. “But it depends on where the banana is in its ripening process. Green bananas can contain less than half the amount of sugar than ripe ones.” For those concerned about blood sugar levels with more yellow bananas, pairing the fruit with a protein source (such as a handful of nuts or a cheese stick) can help better regulate the increase. While bananas may seem like a perfect food, they may not be the best choice for you if you have certain health conditions or concerns. Here’s why. Bananas are a healthy food option packed with nutrients lacking in many diets. Most people don’t consume enough fiber, for instance. The same can be said when it comes to potassium and magnesium. They’re also versatile in the kitchen. They make a great smoothie mixer or a tasty topper on cereal or oatmeal, for instance. They’re ideal for baking, too. (Banana muffins, anyone?) Best of all, bananas rank as one of the more inexpensive fruits in the produce aisle.
