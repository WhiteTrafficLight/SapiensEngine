## 🤖 **Meet the AI Philosophers**

Each philosopher has unique characteristics that influence their debate behavior:

| Philosopher | Strategy Preference | RAG Usage | Signature Style |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Socrates** | Clipping (0.35) | Medium | Questioning to expose logical gaps |
| **Nietzsche** | Framing Shift (0.25) | Low | Value subversion and reframing |
| **Kant** | Reductive Paradox (0.3) | Very High | Logical consistency pursuit |
| **Wittgenstein** | Conceptual Undermining (0.5) | Very High | Language precision focus |

*[Full philosopher database with 15+ personas](./philosophers/README.md)*

## ⚔️ **Advanced Debate Mechanics**

### Strategic Intelligence System
```python
# Dynamic RAG usage based on strategy selection
rag_score = Σ(strategy_weight[i] × philosopher_rag_stat[i])

# Example: Nietzsche using "Framing Shift" strategy
# rag_score = 0.07 (Low → No RAG usage)
# vs. Kant using "Conceptual Undermining" 
# rag_score = 0.86 (High → RAG usage)
```

### Argument Analysis Pipeline
1. **Vulnerability Detection** - Real-time weak point identification
2. **Strategy Selection** - Weighted algorithm choosing optimal attack approach
3. **RAG Integration** - Context-aware knowledge retrieval
4. **Response Generation** - Philosopher-specific argument crafting
