Like, how much of a threat are we talking about, really?\n\nLet me introduce our speakers. On the 'threat' side, we have the ever-skeptical philosopher of the absurd, Mr. Camus. And on the 'no, it's progress, not peril' side, representing the raw force of transformation, Mr. Nietzsche.\n\nSo… before we dive in, what do you guys think? I mean, are we talking about machines stealing jobs—or stealing souls?  \nAlright, let's roll. Mr. Camus, please start us off."

      "text": "Good evening, and thank you for joining today's philosophical debate. Our topic: 'Will AI threaten humanity?' As artificial intelligence progresses, it challenges not only our social and economic structures, but also our ethics, identity, and humanity itself.\n\nTo explore this question, we are joined by two distinguished figures. Representing the view rooted in existential limits and human absurdity, Albert Camus. And offering a vision of human transcendence through creative power, Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nCan AI surpass humanity? And if so, is that a threat—or an opportunity? Let us begin with the perspective of Mr. Camus."

Today's topic is… *drumroll please*—'Will AI threaten humanity?!'  \nLike, are we doomed or not? Just kidding… sort of.\n\nWe've got some killer guests today. On the 'AI is a danger' side, it's the king of existential dread, Camus! And arguing that 'No, we must transcend ourselves!'—the one and only Nietzsche!\n\nThey're both heavyweights, so buckle up. Let's get into it!"

The question we pose today is simple, yet profound: 'Will AI threaten humanity?'\n\nJoining us are two philosophical voices. Camus, whose reflections on absurdity challenge the illusion of progress. And Nietzsche, who beckons us toward transcendence and creative power.\n\nThis is not merely a debate about technology—it is a confrontation with our future. Let us begin. Mr. Camus, the floor is yours."

But don't worry—we're here to explore it together!\n\nWe're joined by two famous thinkers—Camus, who embraces the human condition as it is, and Nietzsche, who believes humanity must always strive to overcome itself.\n\nLet's enjoy this meaningful dialogue. Mr. Camus, please begin!"
