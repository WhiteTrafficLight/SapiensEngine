Like, how much of a threat are we talking about, really?\n\nLet me introduce our speakers. On the 'threat' side, we have the ever-skeptical philosopher of the absurd, Mr. Camus. And on the 'no, it's progress, not peril' side, representing the raw force of transformation, Mr. Nietzsche.\n\nSo… before we dive in, what do you guys think? I mean, are we talking about machines stealing jobs—or stealing souls?  \nAlright, let's roll. Mr. Camus, please start us off.",
      "transition": "Okay—wow, that was… deep.\nSo, Camus thinks AI might strip us of meaning, or at least mess with what makes us human. And Nietzsche? He's like, bring it on—suffering makes us stronger, let's evolve.\n\nAlright! Time to shake things up. Let's go beyond the intros and have you two talk to each other.\nMr. Nietzsche, care to respond to Camus' gloomy vibes?"

      "opening": "Good evening, and thank you for joining today's philosophical debate. Our topic: 'Will AI threaten humanity?' As artificial intelligence progresses, it challenges not only our social and economic structures, but also our ethics, identity, and humanity itself.\n\nTo explore this question, we are joined by two distinguished figures. Representing the view rooted in existential limits and human absurdity, Albert Camus. And offering a vision of human transcendence through creative power, Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nCan AI surpass humanity? And if so, is that a threat—or an opportunity? Let us begin with the perspective of Mr. Camus.",
      "transition": "Thank you, gentlemen, for your thoughtful opening statements.\n\nTo summarize: Mr. Camus warns that AI may deepen the absurdity of the human condition, reducing autonomy and meaning. Mr. Nietzsche, in contrast, sees in AI a potential catalyst for transcendence—an opportunity to affirm life through transformation.\n\nLet us now move beyond the initial perspectives and enter the stage of direct engagement.\nMr. Nietzsche, you may offer your response to Mr. Camus."

Today's topic is… *drumroll please*—'Will AI threaten humanity?!'  \nLike, are we doomed or not? Just kidding… sort of.\n\nWe've got some killer guests today. On the 'AI is a danger' side, it's the king of existential dread, Camus! And arguing that 'No, we must transcend ourselves!'—the one and only Nietzsche!\n\nThey're both heavyweights, so buckle up. Let's get into it!",
      "transition": "Phew! Okay that was intense—Camus basically said 'AI is the new absurd monster,'\nand Nietzsche? He's like 'Let the chaos come, baby—it's how we grow!'\n\nAlright, enough solo talk—let's get spicy.\nNietzsche, Camus just threw down some existential heat. What's your comeback?"

      "opening": "…We stand at the threshold of an era where machines begin to peer across the boundary of the human. The question we pose today is simple, yet profound: 'Will AI threaten humanity?'\n\nJoining us are two philosophical voices. Camus, whose reflections on absurdity challenge the illusion of progress. And Nietzsche, who beckons us toward transcendence and creative power.\n\nThis is not merely a debate about technology—it is a confrontation with our future. Let us begin. Mr. Camus, the floor is yours.",
      "transition": "Camus speaks of the void—of machines magnifying the absurd and leaving us unmoored.\nNietzsche stands on the precipice, welcoming the storm as the fire through which humanity is reborn.\n\nNow, as tension deepens, let thought clash with thought.\nNietzsche, answer not just with words—but with vision. The floor is yours."

      "opening": "Hello, everyone! Welcome to another session where we explore the world through deep, thoughtful conversation. Today's topic is: 'Will AI threaten humanity?' Sounds a bit scary, right? But don't worry—we're here to explore it together!\n\nWe're joined by two famous thinkers—Camus, who embraces the human condition as it is, and Nietzsche, who believes humanity must always strive to overcome itself.\n\nLet's enjoy this meaningful dialogue. Mr. Camus, please begin!",
      "transition": "Thank you both for your powerful opening thoughts!\n\nSo far, Camus reminds us that AI might take us further from what it means to be human.\nNietzsche challenges that view, saying we must embrace change and grow beyond ourselves.\n\nNow let's connect these ideas more directly.\nMr. Nietzsche, would you like to respond to Mr. Camus' perspective?"
