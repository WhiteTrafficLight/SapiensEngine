This inquiry not only challenges our understanding of personal autonomy but also invites us to consider the broader implications on society and human existence. \n\nRepresenting the pro side, we have the renowned existentialists Jean-Paul Sartre and Friedrich Nietzsche, who will argue that absolute freedom is indeed attainable. They will explore how individuals can transcend societal constraints and harness their inherent freedom to make independent choices.\n\nOn the con side, we are joined by the influential thinkers G.W.F. Hegel and Buddha. They will present their perspective that absolute freedom is an unattainable illusion, bound by the interplay of social structures, moral responsibilities, and existential limitations.\n\nAs we delve into this debate, let us maintain an atmosphere of respect and open-mindedness. We aim to explore these philosophical perspectives with integrity and a commitment to intellectual rigor.\n\nWithout further ado, I invite the pro side, led by Sartre and Nietzsche, to begin the discourse. Let the debate commence.",

      "generated_argument": "Brothers and sisters, let us reflect upon the nature of freedom. Many seek absolute freedom, believing it to be the ultimate path to happiness.

This debate reaches into the very essence of what it means to be human and the responsibilities we hold when wielding the power to alter our genetic fabric.\n\nIn recent years, scientific advancements have made it possible to edit the human germline, opening doors to potentially eradicating inherited diseases such as Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, and cystic fibrosis. Proponents argue that genome editing offers not only a swift and permanent solution to these afflictions but also paves the way for a future where human capabilities could transcend current limitations. With strict regulations and ethical oversight, they believe this technology can be safely integrated into our medical practices, promising healthier generations to come.\n\nConversely, opponents of genetic enhancement caution against the ethical quagmires it presents. They highlight the impossibility of obtaining informed consent from future generations and the profound uncertainty inherent in altering a complex and not fully understood human genome. Concerns about irreversible changes, social inequalities, and the specter of eugenics loom large, suggesting that humanity should tread carefully, if at all, in this domain.\n\nTo navigate this complex issue, we have gathered four distinguished philosophers. On the pro side, we welcome Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre, who will advocate for the potential benefits and advancements offered by genetic enhancement. Representing the con side, we have Immanuel Kant and Confucius, who will articulate the profound ethical concerns and potential risks associated with this practice.\n\nAs we embark on this intellectual journey, let us maintain a spirit of respect and open-mindedness, appreciating the depth and complexity of the arguments presented. I now invite the participants on the pro side to commence the debate with their opening statements. Nietzsche and Sartre, the floor is yours.",

      "generated_argument": "Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nWe stand at the precipice of a profound transformation, one that challenges the very fabric of our existence. The advent of genome editing offers us the unprecedented power to eradicate inherited diseases—Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis—ailments that have long tormented humanity. This technology beckons us to seize control of our biological destiny, to exercise our absolute freedom in shaping not only our lives but the lives of generations to come.\n\nConsider the anguish of a parent watching their child suffer from a debilitating genetic disorder.

              "text": "Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nWe stand at the precipice of a profound transformation, one that challenges the very fabric of our existence. The advent of genome editing offers us the unprecedented power to eradicate inherited diseases—Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis—ailments that have long tormented humanity. This technology beckons us to seize control of our biological destiny, to exercise our absolute freedom in shaping not only our lives but the lives of generations to come.\n\nConsider the anguish of a parent watching their child suffer from a debilitating genetic disorder. With genome editing, we possess the means to prevent such suffering, to ensure that no child is condemned by the arbitrary lottery of genetics.
