        "opening_message": "What's up, debate enthusiasts! Welcome to today's electrifying debate on a topic that's sure to spark a whirlwind of emotions and ethical quandaries. Picture this: You're in the depths of financial despair, with eviction notices piling up and your beloved childhood home on the brink of foreclosure. Your parents need urgent medical care, and you're stuck in a seemingly endless cycle of debt. Just then, a mysterious billionaire swoops in with a jaw-dropping offer: step on this puppy for 10 billion dollars! The puppy will feel temporary pain but will survive, and your financial nightmares? Poof, gone! But can you live with the decision? That's the million, or should I say, billion-dollar question! \n\nIn our virtual ring today, representing the PRO side, we have the existential heavyweights: Nietzsche and Sartre! They're here to argue that the end justifies the means, especially when it comes to solving massive financial problems and helping others. \n\nOn the CON side, we've got the ethical giants: Kant and Confucius! They're standing firm on the principle that no amount of money justifies harming an innocent creature, emphasizing the importance of maintaining moral integrity.\n\nThis is going to be a clash of titans, folks, and I can't wait to see where this debate takes us. Remember, respect and open-mindedness are the names of the game here. Let's dive in and explore the depths of morality, ethics, and human compassion. Without further ado, I'll hand it over to Nietzsche and Sartre to kick things off for the PRO side! Let the debate begin!",

Today, we gather to deliberate upon a profound and challenging ethical dilemma: Should one sacrifice an innocent life to save five others? This debate transcends mere theoretical musings, as it draws upon the very core of our ethical beliefs and societal values. The scenario is set in a bustling emergency room, where a doctor must decide whether to take the life of a healthy individual to save five patients, each with compelling reasons for their survival, including a mother, a scientist, and a teacher.\n\nRepresenting the PRO side, we have Hegel and Marx, who will argue from a perspective that considers the greater good and societal benefits. On the CON side, we have Kant and Buddha, who will uphold the inviolable sanctity of each individual life.\n\nAs we embark on this discussion, let us commit to a respectful and thoughtful exchange of ideas, acknowledging the gravity of the topic at hand. I now invite the PRO side to present their opening statements, setting the stage for a debate that is sure to be both enlightening and thought-provoking. Let us proceed with decorum and respect for all perspectives.",

However, this memory has also shaped who you are today – your empathy, resilience, and understanding of others' pain. Some say our scars make us human, that suffering gives life meaning. But others argue that unnecessary pain prevents us from living fully. Your therapist can't decide for you. The appointment is tomorrow, and the choice will change your identity forever. Do you embrace the pain that makes you who you are, or choose peace at the cost of losing part of yourself?"

Imagine having the power to delete a traumatic memory forever—no more emotional pain, just a vague sense of something that happened. Sounds like a sci-fi movie, right? But it’s real, and it’s happening now with this groundbreaking technology.\n\nWe all have memories that haunt us—maybe it's a past trauma, a loss, or a mistake. These memories can mess with our happiness, relationships, and even our careers. But here’s the twist: those very memories also shape who we are, building our empathy, resilience, and understanding of others. So, should we choose peace of mind or hold onto the pain that makes us human?\n\nJoining us today are some heavy hitters with their unique perspectives. On the PRO side, we have Camus and Sartre, who’ll be arguing why erasing these memories could lead to a more fulfilled life. On the flip side, Nietzsche and Buddha will be representing the CON side, discussing why our scars are essential to our identity and the meaning of life.\n\nLet’s dive into this debate with respect and an open mind. Camus and Sartre, you guys are up first—tell us why you’d hit delete on those painful memories!",

They will present the case for kindness and empathy as a priority in maintaining hope and dignity.\n\nConversely, on the CON side, Kant and Wittgenstein will advocate for the unwavering principle of honesty.
