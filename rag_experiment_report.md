# Debate Agent RAG Enhancement System Experiment Report

## 1. Overview

This experiment investigates methods for automatically enhancing arguments and counterarguments generated by debate participant agents through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Arguments generated by basic LLM-based debate agents often lack specific examples or data. This research proposes methods to automatically identify such arguments and enhance them using web search and vector stores.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Debate Simulation System

The debate system consists of the following key components:

- **DebateDialogue Class**: Manages the overall flow and stages of the debate
- **ParticipantRole**: Defines participant roles (PRO, CON, MODERATOR, etc.)
- **DebateStage**: Defines debate stages (opening statements, rebuttals, Q&A, etc.)
- **Debate Participant Agents**: Agents generate responses according to their assigned roles
- **Emotion Enhancement Module**: Analyzes opponent messages and infers appropriate emotions

### 2.2 RAG Enhancement System

The RAG enhancement system consists of the following components:

- **DebateRagQueryGenerator**: Identifies insufficient arguments in debate messages and generates search queries
- **VectorStore**: Provides document vectorization and search functionality
- **WebSearchRetriever**: Retrieves latest information through web search
- **LLMManager**: Manages communication with language models

3. **Moderator Summary**: First summary provided
4. **Rebuttal Stage**: Each side presents counterarguments to the opponent's position
5. **Moderator Summary**: Second summary provided
6. **Q&A Stage**: Con side questions pro side with responses

### 3.3 Key Dialogue Content

Below is the rebuttal content from the Privacy Rights Defender (CON):

```
First, I will begin my rebuttal against the pro side's arguments. The argument that a balance between technological innovation and personal data protection is necessary seems to miss what I consider more important. That is protecting our digital privacy.

Of course, I cannot deny the benefits that technological innovation brings. But can we really say these benefits are significant enough to justify the risks of privacy invasion? You argued that blockchain technology and anonymization techniques can achieve a balance between personal data protection and data utilization. But can we really call these technologies perfect solutions?

I disagree. No matter how advanced technology becomes, new vulnerabilities will always exist. Recently, various companies have experienced data breach incidents, resulting in the exposure of customers' credit card information, personal identification information, and more. These incidents demonstrate that technological innovation alone cannot perfectly guarantee personal data protection.

Furthermore, the goal of maximizing the social and economic value of data can lead to indiscriminate information collection and unauthorized information sharing. What's important here is that the choice of whether we want to share information and what information we want to share must be guaranteed. Our digital privacy should be in our individual hands.

Finally, you mentioned using data for national security and crime prevention. This is certainly an important issue. However, violating individual privacy for these reasons is absolutely unacceptable. We must find ways to prevent crime and protect the nation while preserving individual privacy.

In conclusion, the future of digital privacy must prioritize personal data protection above all else. While technological innovation is important, as long as there are concerns about privacy invasion, unconditionally accepting it is dangerous. Therefore, protecting our digital privacy is most important, and developing the necessary laws, policies, and technologies for this purpose should take priority.

## 4. RAG Enhancement Algorithm

### 4.1 Argument Analysis Process

The RAG enhancement system proceeds through the following steps:

1. **Argument Identification**: Identify arguments lacking evidence in debate messages
2. **Search Query Generation**: Generate search queries to strengthen each argument
3. **Source Determination**: Determine appropriate information sources (web, vector store, etc.) for each query
4. **Information Retrieval**: Retrieve information from determined sources
5. **Argument Enhancement**: Enhance arguments using retrieved information
6. **Integration**: Integrate enhanced arguments to generate the final message

### 4.2 Analysis Results

A total of 4 arguments lacking evidence were identified in the debate message:

1. **Blockchain Technology Limitations**: Lack of specific cases regarding limitations of blockchain and anonymization technologies
   - Generated queries:
     - limitations of blockchain in privacy protection
     - case studies on anonymization technology failures
     - blockchain privacy weaknesses examples

2. **Data Breach Cases**: Lack of specific statistics or cases regarding recent data breach incidents
   - Generated queries:
     - recent data breach examples 2023
     - statistics on data breaches involving credit card information
     - examples of personal identification information leaks 2023

3. **Risks of Data Value Maximization**: Lack of specific cases regarding indiscriminate information collection and unauthorized information sharing
   - Generated queries:
     - risks of unchecked data collection case studies
     - examples of unauthorized data sharing consequences
     - studies on social economic risks of data maximization

4. **Privacy Invasion Restrictions**: Lack of legal/ethical grounds for arguments against privacy invasion
   - Generated queries:
     - legal cases on privacy infringement
     - ethical implications of privacy invasion
     - examples of privacy laws protecting individuals

### 4.3 RAG-Enhanced Message

```
First, I will begin my rebuttal against the pro side's arguments. The argument that a balance between technological innovation and personal data protection is necessary seems to miss what I consider more important. That is protecting our digital privacy.

Of course, I cannot deny the benefits that technological innovation brings. But can we really say these benefits are significant enough to justify the risks of privacy invasion? While blockchain technology and anonymization techniques present possibilities for achieving a balance between personal data protection and data utilization, questions arise about whether these technologies are perfect solutions. Notably, blockchain has potential to solve personal data protection issues but still faces limitations such as scalability, response time, and security threats. For example, adapting blockchain to digital privacy standards presents several challenges, suggesting that these technologies are not perfect solutions in all situations.

No matter how advanced technology becomes, new vulnerabilities will always exist. Recently, various companies have experienced data breach incidents, resulting in frequent exposure of customers' credit card information and personal identification information. In 2023, a total of 8,214,886,660 data records were breached, with 114 publicly disclosed security incidents occurring in October alone, compromising 867,072,315 records. These incidents clearly demonstrate how easily customers' personal information can be threatened.

Furthermore, the goal of maximizing the social and economic value of data can lead to indiscriminate information collection and unauthorized information sharing. For example, after GDPR implementation, Europe saw increased investment and innovation in privacy-focused technologies, showing that strict regulations can actually promote innovation. This presents ways to maximize data value while strengthening personal data protection. However, without such approaches, internal threats like in Yahoo's case can lead to data breaches, resulting in reputational and financial losses for companies.

Finally, the importance of data utilization for national security and crime prevention is undeniable. However, violating individual privacy for these purposes is absolutely unacceptable. Technologies that can effectively utilize data while protecting privacy already exist, one of which is Homomorphic Encryption. This technology enables analysis while keeping data encrypted, preventing unnecessary exposure of personal information. This is a powerful tool that can simultaneously maintain personal data protection and data utilization value.

In conclusion, the future of digital privacy must prioritize personal data protection above all else. While technological innovation is important, as long as there are concerns about privacy invasion, unconditionally accepting it is dangerous. Therefore, protecting our digital privacy is most important, and developing the necessary laws, policies, and technologies for this purpose should take priority.
