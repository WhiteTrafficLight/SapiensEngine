It\nwill, therefore, give this definition here in such a manner as it\nought to be given, in order to leave this contested point open at\nthe beginning, as it should be. LIFE is the faculty a being has of\nacting according to laws of the faculty of desire. The faculty of\nDESIRE is the being's faculty of becoming by means of its ideas the\ncause of the actual existence of the objects of these ideas.\nPLEASURE is the idea of the agreement of the object, or the action\nwith the subjective conditions of life, i.e., with the faculty of\ncausality of an idea in respect of the actuality of its object (or\nwith the determination of the forces of the subject to action which\nproduces it). I have no further need for the purposes of this critique\nof notions borrowed from psychology; the critique itself supplies\nthe rest. It is easily seen that the question whether the faculty of\ndesire is always based on pleasure, or whether under certain\nconditions pleasure only follows the determination of desire, is by\nthis definition left undecided, for it is composed only of terms\nbelonging to the pure understanding, i.e., of categories which contain\nnothing empirical. Such precaution is very desirable in all philosophy\nand yet is often neglected; namely, not to prejudge questions by\nadventuring definitions before the notion has been completely\nanalysed, which is often very late. It may be observed through the\nwhole course of the critical philosophy (of the theoretical as well as\nthe practical reason) that frequent opportunity offers of supplying\ndefects in the old dogmatic method of philosophy, and of correcting\nerrors which are not observed until we make such rational use of these\nnotions viewing them as a whole."

This is just the opposite of what\nmight be said of pure reason in its speculative employment."

In case the will of a rational being is pathologically\naffected, there may occur a conflict of the maxims with the\npractical laws recognized by itself. For example, one may make it\nhis maxim to let no injury pass unrevenged, and yet he may see that\nthis is not a practical law, but only his own maxim; that, on the\ncontrary, regarded as being in one and the same maxim a rule for the\nwill of every rational being, it must contradict itself. In natural\nphilosophy the principles of what happens, (e.g., the principle of\nequality of action and reaction in the communication of motion) are at\nthe same time laws of nature; for the use of reason there is\ntheoretical and determined by the nature of the object. In practical\nphilosophy, i.e., that which has to do only with the grounds of\ndetermination of the will, the principles which a man makes for\nhimself are not laws by which one is inevitably bound; because\nreason in practical matters has to do with the subject, namely, with\nthe faculty of desire, the special character of which may occasion\nvariety in the rule. The practical rule is always a product of reason,\nbecause it prescribes action as a means to the effect. But in the case\nof a being with whom reason does not of itself determine the will,\nthis rule is an imperative, i.e., a rule characterized by \"shall,\"\nwhich expresses the objective necessitation of the action and\nsignifies that, if reason completely determined the will, the action\nwould inevitably take place according to this rule. Imperatives,\ntherefore, are objectively valid, and are quite distinct from\nmaxims, which are subjective principles. The former either determine\nthe conditions of the causality of the rational being as an\nefficient cause, i.e., merely in reference to the effect and the means\nof attaining it; or they determine the will only, whether it is\nadequate to the effect or not. The former would be hypothetical\nimperatives, and contain mere precepts of skill; the latter, on the\ncontrary, would be categorical, and would alone be practical laws.\nThus maxims are principles, but not imperatives. Imperatives\nthemselves, however, when they are conditional (i.e., do not determine\nthe will simply as will, but only in respect to a desired effect, that\nis, when they are hypothetical imperatives), are practical precepts\nbut not laws. Laws must be sufficient to determine the will as will,\neven before I ask whether I have power sufficient for a desired\neffect, or the means necessary to produce it; hence they are\ncategorical: otherwise they are not laws at all, because the necessity\nis wanting, which, if it is to be practical, must be independent of\nconditions which are pathological and are therefore only\ncontingently connected with the will. Tell a man, for example, that he\nmust be industrious and thrifty in youth, in order that he may not\nwant in old age; this is a correct and important practical precept\nof the will. But it is easy to see that in this case the will is\ndirected to something else which it is presupposed that it desires;\nand as to this desire, we must leave it to the actor himself whether\nhe looks forward to other resources than those of his own acquisition,\nor does not expect to be old, or thinks that in case of future\nnecessity he will be able to make shift with little. Reason, from\nwhich alone can spring a rule involving necessity, does, indeed,\ngive necessity to this precept (else it would not be an imperative),\nbut this is a necessity dependent on subjective conditions, and cannot\nbe supposed in the same degree in all subjects. But that reason may\ngive laws it is necessary that it should only need to presuppose\nitself, because rules are objectively and universally valid only\nwhen they hold without any contingent subjective conditions, which\ndistinguish one rational being from another. Now tell a man that he\nshould never make a deceitful promise, this is a rule which only\nconcerns his will, whether the purposes he may have can be attained\nthereby or not; it is the volition only which is to be determined a\npriori by that rule. If now it is found that this rule is\npractically right, then it is a law, because it is a categorical\nimperative. Thus, practical laws refer to the will only, without\nconsidering what is attained by its causality, and we may disregard\nthis latter (as belonging to the world of sense) in order to have them\nquite pure."

Laws must be sufficient to determine the will as will,\neven before I ask whether I have power sufficient for a desired\neffect, or the means necessary to produce it; hence they are\ncategorical: otherwise they are not laws at all, because the necessity\nis wanting, which, if it is to be practical, must be independent of\nconditions which are pathological and are therefore only\ncontingently connected with the will. Tell a man, for example, that he\nmust be industrious and thrifty in youth, in order that he may not\nwant in old age; this is a correct and important practical precept\nof the will.

Reason, from\nwhich alone can spring a rule involving necessity, does, indeed,\ngive necessity to this precept (else it would not be an imperative),\nbut this is a necessity dependent on subjective conditions, and cannot\nbe supposed in the same degree in all subjects.

In case the will of a rational being is pathologically\naffected, there may occur a conflict of the maxims with the\npractical laws recognized by itself. For example, one may make it\nhis maxim to let no injury pass unrevenged, and yet he may see that\nthis is not a practical law, but only his own maxim; that, on the\ncontrary, regarded as being in one and the same maxim a rule for the\nwill of every rational being, it must contradict itself. In natural\nphilosophy the principles of what happens, (e.g., the principle of\nequality of action and reaction in the communication of motion) are at\nthe same time laws of nature; for the use of reason there is\ntheoretical and determined by the nature of the object. In practical\nphilosophy, i.e., that which has to do only with the grounds of\ndetermination of the will, the principles which a man makes for\nhimself are not laws by which one is inevitably bound; because\nreason in practical matters has to do with the subject, namely, with\nthe faculty of desire, the special character of which may occasion\nvariety in the rule. The practical rule is always a product of reason,\nbecause it prescribes action as a means to the effect. But in the case\nof a being with whom reason does not of itself determine the will,\nthis rule is an imperative, i.e., a rule characterized by \"shall,\"\nwhich expresses the objective necessitation of the action and\nsignifies that, if reason completely determined the will, the action\nwould inevitably take place according to this rule. Imperatives,\ntherefore, are objectively valid, and are quite distinct from\nmaxims, which are subjective principles. The former either determine\nthe conditions of the causality of the rational being as an\nefficient cause, i.e., merely in reference to the effect and the means\nof attaining it; or they determine the will only, whether it is\nadequate to the effect or not. The former would be hypothetical\nimperatives, and contain mere precepts of skill; the latter, on the\ncontrary, would be categorical, and would alone be practical laws.\nThus maxims are principles, but not imperatives. Imperatives\nthemselves, however, when they are conditional (i.e., do not determine\nthe will simply as will, but only in respect to a desired effect, that\nis, when they are hypothetical imperatives), are practical precepts\nbut not laws. Laws must be sufficient to determine the will as will,\neven before I ask whether I have power sufficient for a desired\neffect, or the means necessary to produce it; hence they are\ncategorical: otherwise they are not laws at all, because the necessity\nis wanting, which, if it is to be practical, must be independent of\nconditions which are pathological and are therefore only\ncontingently connected with the will. Tell a man, for example, that he\nmust be industrious and thrifty in youth, in order that he may not\nwant in old age; this is a correct and important practical precept\nof the will. But it is easy to see that in this case the will is\ndirected to something else which it is presupposed that it desires;\nand as to this desire, we must leave it to the actor himself whether\nhe looks forward to other resources than those of his own acquisition,\nor does not expect to be old, or thinks that in case of future\nnecessity he will be able to make shift with little.

Whether an idea has\nits seat and source in the understanding or not, if it can only\ndetermine the choice by presupposing a feeling of pleasure in the\nsubject, it follows that its capability of determining the choice\ndepends altogether on the nature of the inner sense, namely, that this\ncan be agreeably affected by it. However dissimilar ideas of objects\nmay be, though they be ideas of the understanding, or even of the\nreason in contrast to ideas of sense, yet the feeling of pleasure,\nby means of which they constitute the determining principle of the\nwill (the expected satisfaction which impels the activity to the\nproduction of the object), is of one and the same kind, not only\ninasmuch as it can only be known empirically, but also inasmuch as\nit affects one and the same vital force which manifests itself in\nthe faculty of desire, and in this respect can only differ in degree\nfrom every other ground of determination. Otherwise, how could we\ncompare in respect of magnitude two principles of determination, the\nideas of which depend upon different faculties, so as to prefer that\nwhich affects the faculty of desire in the highest degree. The same\nman may return unread an instructive book which he cannot again\nobtain, in order not to miss a hunt; he may depart in the midst of a\nfine speech, in order not to be late for dinner; he may leave a\nrational conversation, such as he otherwise values highly, to take his\nplace at the gaming-table; he may even repulse a poor man whom he at\nother times takes pleasure in benefiting, because he has only just\nenough money in his pocket to pay for his admission to the theatre. If\nthe determination of his will rests on the feeling of the\nagreeableness or disagreeableness that he expects from any cause, it\nis all the same to him by what sort of ideas he will be affected.\nThe only thing that concerns him, in order to decide his choice, is,\nhow great, how long continued, how easily obtained, and how often\nrepeated, this agreeableness is. Just as to the man who wants money to\nspend, it is all the same whether the gold was dug out of the mountain\nor washed out of the sand, provided it is everywhere accepted at the\nsame value; so the man who cares only for the enjoyment of life does\nnot ask whether the ideas are of the understanding or the senses,\nbut only how much and how great pleasure they will give for the\nlongest time. It is only those that would gladly deny to pure reason\nthe power of determining the will, without the presupposition of any\nfeeling, who could deviate so far from their own exposition as to\ndescribe as quite heterogeneous what they have themselves previously\nbrought under one and the same principle. Thus, for example, it is\nobserved that we can find pleasure in the mere exercise of power, in\nthe consciousness of our strength of mind in overcoming obstacles\nwhich are opposed to our designs, in the culture of our mental\ntalents, etc.; and we justly call these more refined pleasures and\nenjoyments, because they are more in our power than others; they do\nnot wear out, but rather increase the capacity for further enjoyment\nof them, and while they delight they at the same time cultivate. But\nto say on this account that they determine the will in a different way\nand not through sense, whereas the possibility of the pleasure\npresupposes a feeling for it implanted in us, which is the first\ncondition of this satisfaction; this is just as when ignorant\npersons that like to dabble in metaphysics imagine matter so subtle,\nso supersubtle that they almost make themselves giddy with it, and\nthen think that in this way they have conceived it as a spiritual\nand yet extended being. If with Epicurus we make virtue determine\nthe will only by means of the pleasure it promises, we cannot\nafterwards blame him for holding that this pleasure is of the same\nkind as those of the coarsest senses.

For it is every man's own special feeling of pleasure\nand pain that decides in what he is to place his happiness, and even\nin the same subject this will vary with the difference of his wants\naccording as this feeling changes, and thus a law which is\nsubjectively necessary (as a law of nature) is objectively a very\ncontingent practical principle, which can and must be very different\nin different subjects and therefore can never furnish a law; since, in\nthe desire for happiness it is not the form (of conformity to law)\nthat is decisive, but simply the matter, namely, whether I am to\nexpect pleasure in following the law, and how much. Principles of\nself-love may, indeed, contain universal precepts of skill (how to\nfind means to accomplish one's purpose), but in that case they are\nmerely theoretical principles; * as, for example, how he who would\nlike to eat bread should contrive a mill; but practical precepts\nfounded on them can never be universal, for the determining principle\nof the desire is based on the feeling pleasure and pain, which can\nnever be supposed to be universally directed to the same objects."

It is therefore the moral\nlaw, of which we become directly conscious (as soon as we trace for\nourselves maxims of the will), that first presents itself to us, and\nleads directly to the concept of freedom, inasmuch as reason\npresents it as a principle of determination not to be outweighed by\nany sensible conditions, nay, wholly independent of them.

Now this\nprinciple of morality, just on account of the universality of the\nlegislation which makes it the formal supreme determining principle of\nthe will, without regard to any subjective differences, is declared by\nthe reason to be a law for all rational beings, in so far as they have\na will, that is, a power to determine their causality by the\nconception of rules; and, therefore, so far as they are capable of\nacting according to principles, and consequently also according to\npractical a priori principles (for these alone have the necessity that\nreason requires in a principle).

    "paragraph_content": "The fact just mentioned is undeniable. It is only necessary to\nanalyse the judgement that men pass on the lawfulness of their\nactions, in order to find that, whatever inclination may say to the\ncontrary, reason, incorruptible and self-constrained, always\nconfronts the maxim of the will in any action with the pure will, that\nis, with itself, considering itself as a priori practical. Now this\nprinciple of morality, just on account of the universality of the\nlegislation which makes it the formal supreme determining principle of\nthe will, without regard to any subjective differences, is declared by\nthe reason to be a law for all rational beings, in so far as they have\na will, that is, a power to determine their causality by the\nconception of rules; and, therefore, so far as they are capable of\nacting according to principles, and consequently also according to\npractical a priori principles (for these alone have the necessity that\nreason requires in a principle). It is, therefore, not limited to\nmen only, but applies to all finite beings that possess reason and\nwill; nay, it even includes the Infinite Being as the supreme\nintelligence. In the former case, however, the law has the form of\nan imperative, because in them, as rational beings, we can suppose a\npure will, but being creatures affected with wants and physical\nmotives, not a holy will, that is, one which would be incapable of any\nmaxim conflicting with the moral law. In their case, therefore, the\nmoral law is an imperative, which commands categorically, because\nthe law is unconditioned; the relation of such a will to this law is\ndependence under the name of obligation, which implies a constraint to\nan action, though only by reason and its objective law; and this\naction is called duty, because an elective will, subject to\npathological affections (though not determined by them, and,\ntherefore, still free), implies a wish that arises from subjective\ncauses and, therefore, may often be opposed to the pure objective\ndetermining principle; whence it requires the moral constraint of a\nresistance of the practical reason, which may be called an internal,\nbut intellectual, compulsion. In the supreme intelligence the elective\nwill is rightly conceived as incapable of any maxim which could not at\nthe same time be objectively a law; and the notion of holiness,\nwhich on that account belongs to it, places it, not indeed above all\npractical laws, but above all practically restrictive laws, and\nconsequently above obligation and duty. This holiness of will is,\nhowever, a practical idea, which must necessarily serve as a type to\nwhich finite rational beings can only approximate indefinitely, and\nwhich the pure moral law, which is itself on this account called holy,\nconstantly and rightly holds before their eyes. The utmost that finite\npractical reason can effect is to be certain of this indefinite\nprogress of one's maxims and of their steady disposition to advance.\nThis is virtue, and virtue, at least as a naturally acquired\nfaculty, can never be perfect, because assurance in such a case\nnever becomes apodeictic certainty and, when it only amounts to\npersuasion, is very dangerous."

All\nthe matter of practical rules rests on subjective conditions, which\ngive them only a conditional universality (in case I desire this or\nthat, what I must do in order to obtain it), and they all turn on\nthe principle of private happiness. Now, it is indeed undeniable\nthat every volition must have an object, and therefore a matter; but\nit does not follow that this is the determining principle and the\ncondition of the maxim; for, if it is so, then this cannot be\nexhibited in a universally legislative form, since in that case the\nexpectation of the existence of the object would be the determining\ncause of the choice, and the volition must presuppose the dependence\nof the faculty of desire on the existence of something; but this\ndependence can only be sought in empirical conditions and,\ntherefore, can never furnish a foundation for a necessary and\nuniversal rule. Thus, the happiness of others may be the object of the\nwill of a rational being.

This (rule), if I\nattribute it to everyone (as, in fact, I may, in the case of every\nfinite being), can become an objective practical law only if I include\nthe happiness of others. Therefore, the law that we should promote the\nhappiness of others does not arise from the assumption that this is an\nobject of everyone's choice, but merely from this, that the form of\nuniversality which reason requires as the condition of giving to a\nmaxim of self-love the objective validity of a law is the principle\nthat determines the will.

To look, however, on all\nrewards and punishments as merely the machinery in the hand of a\nhigher power, which is to serve only to set rational creatures\nstriving after their final end (happiness), this is to reduce the will\nto a mechanism destructive of freedom; this is so evident that it need\nnot detain us."

Now, the law of this autonomy is the moral law,\nwhich, therefore, is the fundamental law of a supersensible nature,\nand of a pure world of understanding, whose counterpart must exist\nin the world of sense, but without interfering with its laws. We might\ncall the former the archetypal world (natura archetypa), which we only\nknow in the reason; and the latter the ectypal world (natura\nectypa), because it contains the possible effect of the idea of the\nformer which is the determining principle of the will. For the moral\nlaw, in fact, transfers us ideally into a system in which pure reason,\nif it were accompanied with adequate physical power, would produce the\nsummum bonum, and it determines our will to give the sensible world\nthe form of a system of rational beings."

    "paragraph_content": "The determination of the causality of beings in the world of\nsense, as such, can never be unconditioned; and yet for every series\nof conditions there must be something unconditioned, and therefore\nthere must be a causality which is determined wholly by itself. Hence,\nthe idea of freedom as a faculty of absolute spontaneity was not found\nto be a want but, as far as its possibility is concerned, an\nanalytic principle of pure speculative reason. But as it is absolutely\nimpossible to find in experience any example in accordance with this\nidea, because amongst the causes of things as phenomena it would be\nimpossible to meet with any absolutely unconditioned determination\nof causality, we were only able to defend our supposition that a\nfreely acting cause might be a being in the world of sense, in so\nfar as it is considered in the other point of view as a noumenon,\nshowing that there is no contradiction in regarding all its actions as\nsubject to physical conditions so far as they are phenomena, and yet\nregarding its causality as physically unconditioned, in so far as\nthe acting being belongs to the world of understanding, and in thus\nmaking the concept of freedom the regulative principle of reason. By\nthis principle I do not indeed learn what the object is to which\nthat sort of causality is attributed; but I remove the difficulty,\nfor, on the one side, in the explanation of events in the world, and\nconsequently also of the actions of rational beings, I leave to the\nmechanism of physical necessity the right of ascending from\nconditioned to condition ad infinitum, while on the other side I\nkeep open for speculative reason the place which for it is vacant,\nnamely, the intelligible, in order to transfer the unconditioned\nthither. But I was not able to verify this supposition; that is, to\nchange it into the knowledge of a being so acting, not even into the\nknowledge of the possibility of such a being. This vacant place is now\nfilled by pure practical reason with a definite law of causality in an\nintelligible world (causality with freedom), namely, the moral law.\nSpeculative reason does not hereby gain anything as regards its\ninsight, but only as regards the certainty of its problematical notion\nof freedom, which here obtains objective reality, which, though only\npractical, is nevertheless undoubted. Even the notion of causality-\nthe application, and consequently the signification, of which holds\nproperly only in relation to phenomena, so as to connect them into\nexperiences (as is shown by the Critique of Pure Reason)- is not so\nenlarged as to extend its use beyond these limits.

    "paragraph_content": "David Hume, of whom we may say that he commenced the assault on\nthe claims of pure reason, which made a thorough investigation of it\nnecessary, argued thus: The notion of cause is a notion that\ninvolves the necessity of the connexion of the existence of\ndifferent things (and that, in so far as they are different), so that,\ngiven A, I know that something quite distinct there from, namely B,\nmust necessarily also exist. Now necessity can be attributed to a\nconnection, only in so far as it is known a priori, for experience\nwould only enable us to know of such a connection that it exists,\nnot that it necessarily exists. Now, it is impossible, says he, to\nknow a priori and as necessary the connection between one thing and\nanother (or between one attribute and another quite distinct) when\nthey have not been given in experience. Therefore the notion of a\ncause is fictitious and delusive and, to speak in the mildest way,\nis an illusion, only excusable inasmuch as the custom (a subjective\nnecessity) of perceiving certain things, or their attributes as\noften associated in existence along with or in succession to one\nanother, is insensibly taken for an objective necessity of supposing\nsuch a connection in the objects themselves; and thus the notion of\na cause has been acquired surreptitiously and not legitimately; nay,\nit can never be so acquired or authenticated, since it demands a\nconnection in itself vain, chimerical, and untenable in presence of\nreason, and to which no object can ever correspond. In this way was\nempiricism first introduced as the sole source of principles, as far\nas all knowledge of the existence of things is concerned\n(mathematics therefore remaining excepted); and with empiricism the\nmost thorough scepticism, even with regard to the whole science of\nnature( as philosophy). For on such principles we can never conclude\nfrom given attributes of things as existing to a consequence (for this\nwould require the notion of cause, which involves the necessity of\nsuch a connection); we can only, guided by imagination, expect similar\ncases- an expectation which is never certain, however often it has\nbeen fulfilled. Of no event could we say: a certain thing must have\npreceded it, on which it necessarily followed; that is, it must have a\ncause; and therefore, however frequent the cases we have known in\nwhich there was such an antecedent, so that a rule could be derived\nfrom them, yet we never could suppose it as always and necessarily\nso happening; we should, therefore, be obliged to leave its share to\nblind chance, with which all use of reason comes to an end; and this\nfirmly establishes scepticism in reference to arguments ascending from\neffects to causes and makes it impregnable."

On the other hand,\nif the law can be considered a priori as the determining principle\nof the action, and the latter therefore as determined by pure\npractical reason, the judgement whether a thing is an object of pure\npractical reason or not does not depend at all on the comparison\nwith our physical power; and the question is only whether we should\nwill an action that is directed to the existence of an object, if\nthe object were in our power; hence the previous question is only as\nthe moral possibility of the action, for in this case it is not the\nobject, but the law of the will, that is the determining principle\nof the action. The only objects of practical reason are therefore\nthose of good and evil. For by the former is meant an object\nnecessarily desired according to a principle of reason; by the\nlatter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of\nreason."

So that we express\ntwo quite distinct judgements when we consider in an action the good\nand evil of it, or our weal and woe (ill). Hence it already follows\nthat the above quoted psychological proposition is at least very\ndoubtful if it is translated: \"We desire nothing except with a view to\nour weal or woe\"; on the other hand, if we render it thus: \"Under\nthe direction of reason we desire nothing except so far as we esteem\nit good or evil,\" it is indubitably certain and at the same time quite\nclearly expressed."

Supposing that we\nwished to begin with the concept of good, in order to deduce from it\nthe laws of the will, then this concept of an object (as a good) would\nat the same time assign to us this object as the sole determining\nprinciple of the will. Now, since this concept had not any practical a\npriori law for its standard, the criterion of good or evil could not\nbe placed in anything but the agreement of the object with our feeling\nof pleasure or pain; and the use of reason could only consist in\ndetermining in the first place this pleasure or pain in connexion with\nall the sensations of my existence, and in the second place the\nmeans of securing to myself the object of the pleasure. Now, as\nexperience alone can decide what conforms to the feeling of\npleasure, and by hypothesis the practical law is to be based on this\nas a condition, it follows that the possibility of a priori\npractical laws would be at once excluded, because it was imagined to\nbe necessary first of all to find an object the concept of which, as a\ngood, should constitute the universal though empirical principle of\ndetermination of the will. But what it was necessary to inquire\nfirst of all was whether there is not an a priori determining\nprinciple of the will (and this could never be found anywhere but in a\npure practical law, in so far as this law prescribes to maxims\nmerely their form without regard to an object). Since, however, we\nlaid the foundation of all practical law in an object determined by\nour conceptions of good and evil, whereas without a previous law\nthat object could not be conceived by empirical concepts, we have\ndeprived ourselves beforehand of the possibility of even conceiving\na pure practical law. On the other hand, if we had first\ninvestigated the latter analytically, we should have found that it\nis not the concept of good as an object that determines the moral\nlaw and makes it possible, but that, on the contrary, it is the\nmoral law that first determines the concept of good and makes it\npossible, so far as it deserves the name of good absolutely."

    "paragraph_content": "Now, since the notions of good and evil, as consequences of the a\npriori determination of the will, imply also a pure practical\nprinciple, and therefore a causality of pure reason; hence they do not\noriginally refer to objects (so as to be, for instance, special\nmodes of the synthetic unity of the manifold of given intuitions in\none consciousness) like the pure concepts of the understanding or\ncategories of reason in its theoretic employment; on the contrary,\nthey presuppose that objects are given; but they are all modes\n(modi) of a single category, namely, that of causality, the\ndetermining principle of which consists in the rational conception\nof a law, which as a law of freedom reason gives to itself, thereby\na priori proving itself practical. However, as the actions on the\none side come under a law which is not a physical law, but a law of\nfreedom, and consequently belong to the conduct of beings in the world\nof intelligence, yet on the other side as events in the world of sense\nthey belong to phenomena; hence the determinations of a practical\nreason are only possible in reference to the latter and, therefore, in\naccordance with the categories of the understanding; not indeed with a\nview to any theoretic employment of it, i.e., so as to bring the\nmanifold of (sensible) intuition under one consciousness a priori; but\nonly to subject the manifold of desires to the unity of\nconsciousness of a practical reason, giving it commands in the moral\nlaw, i.e., to a pure will a priori."

    "paragraph_content": "Since, then, for the purpose of giving the moral law influence\nover the will, we must not seek for any other motives that might\nenable us to dispense with the motive of the law itself, because\nthat would produce mere hypocrisy, without consistency; and it is even\ndangerous to allow other motives (for instance, that of interest) even\nto co-operate along with the moral law; hence nothing is left us but\nto determine carefully in what way the moral law becomes a motive, and\nwhat effect this has upon the faculty of desire. For as to the\nquestion how a law can be directly and of itself a determining\nprinciple of the will (which is the essence of morality), this is, for\nhuman reason, an insoluble problem and identical with the question:\nhow a free will is possible. Therefore what we have to show a priori\nis not why the moral law in itself supplies a motive, but what\neffect it, as such, produces (or, more correctly speaking, must\nproduce) on the mind."

    "paragraph_content": "While the moral law, therefore, is a formal determining principle of\naction by practical pure reason, and is moreover a material though\nonly objective determining principle of the objects of action as\ncalled good and evil, it is also a subjective determining principle,\nthat is, a motive to this action, inasmuch as it has influence on\nthe morality of the subject and produces a feeling conducive to the\ninfluence of the law on the will. There is here in the subject no\nantecedent feeling tending to morality. For this is impossible,\nsince every feeling is sensible, and the motive of moral intention\nmust be free from all sensible conditions. On the contrary, while\nthe sensible feeling which is at the bottom of all our inclinations is\nthe condition of that impression which we call respect, the cause that\ndetermines it lies in the pure practical reason; and this impression\ntherefore, on account of its origin, must be called, not a\npathological but a practical effect. For by the fact that the\nconception of the moral law deprives self-love of its influence, and\nself-conceit of its illusion, it lessens the obstacle to pure\npractical reason and produces the conception of the superiority of its\nobjective law to the impulses of the sensibility; and thus, by\nremoving the counterpoise, it gives relatively greater weight to the\nlaw in the judgement of reason (in the case of a will affected by\nthe aforesaid impulses). Thus the respect for the law is not a\nmotive to morality, but is morality itself subjectively considered\nas a motive, inasmuch as pure practical reason, by rejecting all the\nrival pretensions of self-love, gives authority to the law, which now\nalone has influence. Now it is to be observed that as respect is an\neffect on feeling, and therefore on the sensibility, of a rational\nbeing, it presupposes this sensibility, and therefore also the\nfiniteness of such beings on whom the moral law imposes respect; and\nthat respect for the law cannot be attributed to a supreme being, or\nto any being free from all sensibility, in whom, therefore, this\nsensibility cannot be an obstacle to practical reason."

The latter\nmay arouse inclination, and if they are animals (e.g., horses, dogs,\netc.), even love or fear, like the sea, a volcano, a beast of prey;\nbut never respect. Something that comes nearer to this feeling is\nadmiration, and this, as an affection, astonishment, can apply to\nthings also, e.g., lofty mountains, the magnitude, number, and\ndistance of the heavenly bodies, the strength and swiftness of many\nanimals, etc. But all this is not respect. A man also may be an object\nto me of love, fear, or admiration, even to astonishment, and yet\nnot be an object of respect. His jocose humour, his courage and\nstrength, his power from the rank he has amongst others, may inspire\nme with sentiments of this kind, but still inner respect for him is\nwanting. Fontenelle says, \"I bow before a great man, but my mind\ndoes not bow.\" I would add, before an humble plain man, in whom I\nperceive uprightness of character in a higher degree than I am\nconscious of in myself,- my mind bows whether I choose it or not,\nand though I bear my head never so high that he may not forget my\nsuperior rank. Why is this? Because his example exhibits to me a law\nthat humbles my self-conceit when I compare it with my conduct: a law,\nthe practicability of obedience to which I see proved by fact before\nmy eyes.

Can it be thought that it is for any\nother reason that we are so ready to reduce it to the level of our\nfamiliar inclination, or that it is for any other reason that we all\ntake such trouble to make it out to be the chosen precept of our own\ninterest well understood, but that we want to be free from the\ndeterrent respect which shows us our own unworthiness with such\nseverity? Nevertheless, on the other hand, so little is there pain\nin it that if once one has laid aside self-conceit and allowed\npractical influence to that respect, he can never be satisfied with\ncontemplating the majesty of this law, and the soul believes itself\nelevated in proportion as it sees the holy law elevated above it and\nits frail nature. No doubt great talents and activity proportioned\nto them may also occasion respect or an analogous feeling. It is\nvery proper to yield it to them, and then it appears as if this\nsentiment were the same thing as admiration. But if we look closer\nwe shall observe that it is always uncertain how much of the ability\nis due to native talent, and how much to diligence in cultivating\nit. Reason represents it to us as probably the fruit of cultivation,\nand therefore as meritorious, and this notably reduces our\nself-conceit, and either casts a reproach on us or urges us to\nfollow such an example in the way that is suitable to us. This\nrespect, then, which we show to such a person (properly speaking, to\nthe law that his example exhibits) is not mere admiration; and this is\nconfirmed also by the fact that when the common run of admirers\nthink they have learned from any source the badness of such a man's\ncharacter (for instance Voltaire's) they give up all respect for\nhim; whereas the true scholar still feels it at least with regard to\nhis talents, because he is himself engaged in a business and a\nvocation which make imitation of such a man in some degree a law."

But since the same law is objectively,\nthat is, in the conception of pure reason, an immediate principle of\ndetermination of the will, and consequently this humiliation takes\nplace only relatively to the purity of the law; hence, the lowering of\nthe pretensions of moral self-esteem, that is, humiliation on the\nsensible side, is an elevation of the moral, i.e., practical, esteem\nfor the law itself on the intellectual side; in a word, it is\nrespect for the law, and therefore, as its cause is intellectual, a\npositive feeling which can be known a priori. For whatever\ndiminishes the obstacles to an activity furthers this activity itself.\nNow the recognition of the moral law is the consciousness of an\nactivity of practical reason from objective principles, which only\nfails to reveal its effect in actions because subjective\n(pathological) causes hinder it. Respect for the moral law then must\nbe regarded as a positive, though indirect, effect of it on feeling,\ninasmuch as this respect weakens the impeding influence of\ninclinations by humiliating self-esteem; and hence also as a subjective\nprinciple of activity, that is, as a motive to obedience to the law,\nand as a principle of the maxims of a life conformable to it. From the\nnotion of a motive arises that of an interest, which can never be\nattributed to any being unless it possesses reason, and which\nsignifies a motive of the will in so far as it is conceived by the\nreason. Since in a morally good will the law itself must be the\nmotive, the moral interest is a pure interest of practical reason\nalone, independent of sense. On the notion of an interest is based\nthat of a maxim. This, therefore, is morally good only in case it\nrests simply on the interest taken in obedience to the law. All\nthree notions, however, that of a motive, of an interest, and of a\nmaxim, can be applied only to finite beings. For they all suppose a\nlimitation of the nature of the being, in that the subjective\ncharacter of his choice does not of itself agree with the objective\nlaw of a practical reason; they suppose that the being requires to\nbe impelled to action by something, because an internal obstacle\nopposes itself. Therefore they cannot be applied to the Divine will."

The\nsame affection towards men is possible no doubt, but cannot be\ncommanded, for it is not in the power of any man to love anyone at\ncommand; therefore it is only practical love that is meant in that\npith of all laws. To love God means, in this sense, to like to do\nHis commandments; to love one's neighbour means to like to practise\nall duties towards him. But the command that makes this a rule\ncannot command us to have this disposition in actions conformed to\nduty, but only to endeavour after it. For a command to like to do a\nthing is in itself contradictory, because if we already know of\nourselves what we are bound to do, and if further we are conscious\nof liking to do it, a command would be quite needless; and if we do it\nnot willingly, but only out of respect for the law, a command that\nmakes this respect the motive of our maxim would directly counteract\nthe disposition commanded. That law of all laws, therefore, like all\nthe moral precepts of the Gospel, exhibits the moral disposition in\nall its perfection, in which, viewed as an ideal of holiness, it is\nnot attainable by any creature, but yet is the pattern which we should\nstrive to approach, and in an uninterrupted but infinite progress\nbecome like to. In fact, if a rational creature could ever reach\nthis point, that he thoroughly likes to do all moral laws, this\nwould mean that there does not exist in him even the possibility of\na desire that would tempt him to deviate from them; for to overcome\nsuch a desire always costs the subject some sacrifice and therefore\nrequires self-compulsion, that is, inward constraint to something that\none does not quite like to do; and no creature can ever reach this\nstage of moral disposition. For, being a creature, and therefore\nalways dependent with respect to what he requires for complete\nsatisfaction, he can never be quite free from desires and\ninclinations, and as these rest on physical causes, they can never\nof themselves coincide with the moral law, the sources of which are\nquite different; and therefore they make it necessary to found the\nmental disposition of one's maxims on moral obligation, not on ready\ninclination, but on respect, which demands obedience to the law,\neven though one may not like it; not on love, which apprehends no\ninward reluctance of the will towards the law. Nevertheless, this\nlatter, namely, love to the law (which would then cease to be a\ncommand, and then morality, which would have passed subjectively\ninto holiness, would cease to be virtue) must be the constant though\nunattainable goal of his endeavours. For in the case of what we highly\nesteem, but yet (on account of the consciousness of our weakness)\ndread, the increased facility of satisfying it changes the most\nreverential awe into inclination, and respect into love; at least this\nwould be the perfection of a disposition devoted to the law, if it\nwere possible for a creature to attain it."

The\nsame affection towards men is possible no doubt, but cannot be\ncommanded, for it is not in the power of any man to love anyone at\ncommand; therefore it is only practical love that is meant in that\npith of all laws. To love God means, in this sense, to like to do\nHis commandments; to love one's neighbour means to like to practise\nall duties towards him. But the command that makes this a rule\ncannot command us to have this disposition in actions conformed to\nduty, but only to endeavour after it. For a command to like to do a\nthing is in itself contradictory, because if we already know of\nourselves what we are bound to do, and if further we are conscious\nof liking to do it, a command would be quite needless; and if we do it\nnot willingly, but only out of respect for the law, a command that\nmakes this respect the motive of our maxim would directly counteract\nthe disposition commanded. That law of all laws, therefore, like all\nthe moral precepts of the Gospel, exhibits the moral disposition in\nall its perfection, in which, viewed as an ideal of holiness, it is\nnot attainable by any creature, but yet is the pattern which we should\nstrive to approach, and in an uninterrupted but infinite progress\nbecome like to. In fact, if a rational creature could ever reach\nthis point, that he thoroughly likes to do all moral laws, this\nwould mean that there does not exist in him even the possibility of\na desire that would tempt him to deviate from them; for to overcome\nsuch a desire always costs the subject some sacrifice and therefore\nrequires self-compulsion, that is, inward constraint to something that\none does not quite like to do; and no creature can ever reach this\nstage of moral disposition. For, being a creature, and therefore\nalways dependent with respect to what he requires for complete\nsatisfaction, he can never be quite free from desires and\ninclinations, and as these rest on physical causes, they can never\nof themselves coincide with the moral law, the sources of which are\nquite different; and therefore they make it necessary to found the\nmental disposition of one's maxims on moral obligation, not on ready\ninclination, but on respect, which demands obedience to the law,\neven though one may not like it; not on love, which apprehends no\ninward reluctance of the will towards the law. Nevertheless, this\nlatter, namely, love to the law (which would then cease to be a\ncommand, and then morality, which would have passed subjectively\ninto holiness, would cease to be virtue) must be the constant though\nunattainable goal of his endeavours. For in the case of what we highly\nesteem, but yet (on account of the consciousness of our weakness)\ndread, the increased facility of satisfying it changes the most\nreverential awe into inclination, and respect into love; at least this\nwould be the perfection of a disposition devoted to the law, if it\nwere possible for a creature to attain it."

The stage of morality on which man (and,\nas far as we can see, every rational creature) stands is respect for\nthe moral law. The disposition that he ought to have in obeying this\nis to obey it from duty, not from spontaneous inclination, or from\nan endeavour taken up from liking and unbidden; and this proper\nmoral condition in which he can always be is virtue, that is, moral\ndisposition militant, and not holiness in the fancied possession of\na perfect purity of the disposition of the will. It is nothing but\nmoral fanaticism and exaggerated self-conceit that is infused into the\nmind by exhortation to actions as noble, sublime, and magnanimous,\nby which men are led into the delusion that it is not duty, that is,\nrespect for the law, whose yoke (an easy yoke indeed, because reason\nitself imposes it on us) they must bear, whether they like it or\nnot, that constitutes the determining principle of their actions,\nand which always humbles them while they obey it; fancying that\nthose actions are expected from them, not from duty, but as pure\nmerit.

Without this\nfreedom (in the latter and true sense), which alone is practical a\npriori, no moral law and no moral imputation are possible.

A man may use as much art as\nhe likes in order to paint to himself an unlawful act, that he\nremembers, as an unintentional error, a mere oversight, such as one\ncan never altogether avoid, and therefore as something in which he was\ncarried away by the stream of physical necessity, and thus to make\nhimself out innocent, yet he finds that the advocate who speaks in his\nfavour can by no means silence the accuser within, if only he is\nconscious that at the time when he did this wrong he was in his\nsenses, that is, in possession of his freedom; and, nevertheless, he\naccounts for his error from some bad habits, which by gradual\nneglect of attention he has allowed to grow upon him to such a\ndegree that he can regard his error as its natural consequence,\nalthough this cannot protect him from the blame and reproach which\nhe casts upon himself. This is also the ground of repentance for a\nlong past action at every recollection of it; a painful feeling\nproduced by the moral sentiment, and which is practically void in so\nfar as it cannot serve to undo what has been done. (Hence Priestley,\nas a true and consistent fatalist, declares it absurd, and he deserves\nto be commended for this candour more than those who, while they\nmaintain the mechanism of the will in fact, and its freedom in words\nonly, yet wish it to be thought that they include it in their system\nof compromise, although they do not explain the possibility of such\nmoral imputation.) But the pain is quite legitimate, because when\nthe law of our intelligible [supersensible] existence (the moral\nlaw) is in question, reason recognizes no distinction of time, and\nonly asks whether the event belongs to me, as my act, and then\nalways morally connects the same feeling with it, whether it has\nhappened just now or long ago. For in reference to the supersensible\nconsciousness of its existence (i.e., freedom) the life of sense is\nbut a single phenomenon, which, inasmuch as it contains merely\nmanifestations of the mental disposition with regard to the moral\nlaw (i.e., of the character), must be judged not according to the\nphysical necessity that belongs to it as phenomenon, but according\nto the absolute spontaneity of freedom. It may therefore be admitted\nthat, if it were possible to have so profound an insight into a\nman's mental character as shown by internal as well as external\nactions as to know all its motives, even the smallest, and likewise\nall the external occasions that can influence them, we could calculate\na man's conduct for the future with as great certainty as a lunar or\nsolar eclipse; and nevertheless we may maintain that the man is\nfree. In fact, if we were capable of a further glance, namely, an\nintellectual intuition of the same subject (which indeed is not\ngranted to us, and instead of it we have only the rational concept),\nthen we should perceive that this whole chain of appearances in regard\nto all that concerns the moral laws depends on the spontaneity of\nthe subject as a thing in itself, of the determination of which no\nphysical explanation can be given. In default of this intuition, the\nmoral law assures us of this distinction between the relation of our\nactions as appearance to our sensible nature, and the relation of this\nsensible nature to the supersensible substratum in us. In this view,\nwhich is natural to our reason, though inexplicable, we can also\njustify some judgements which we passed with all conscientiousness,\nand which yet at first sight seem quite opposed to all equity. There\nare cases in which men, even with the same education which has been\nprofitable to others, yet show such early depravity, and so continue\nto progress in it to years of manhood, that they are thought to be\nborn villains, and their character altogether incapable of\nimprovement; and nevertheless they are judged for what they do or\nleave undone, they are reproached for their faults as guilty; nay,\nthey themselves (the children) regard these reproaches as well\nfounded, exactly as if in spite of the hopeless natural quality of\nmind ascribed to them, they remained just as responsible as any\nother man. This could not happen if we did not suppose that whatever\nsprings from a man's choice (as every action intentionally performed\nundoubtedly does) has as its foundation a free causality, which from\nearly youth expresses its character in its manifestations (i.e.,\nactions). These, on account of the uniformity of conduct, exhibit a\nnatural connection, which however does not make the vicious quality of\nthe will necessary, but on the contrary, is the consequence of the\nevil principles voluntarily adopted and unchangeable, which only\nmake it so much the more culpable and deserving of punishment. There\nstill remains a difficulty in the combination of freedom with the\nmechanism of nature in a being belonging to the world of sense; a\ndifficulty which, even after all the foregoing is admitted,\nthreatens freedom with complete destruction. But with this danger\nthere is also a circumstance that offers hope of an issue still\nfavourable to freedom; namely, that the same difficulty presses much\nmore strongly (in fact as we shall presently see, presses only) on the\nsystem that holds the existence determinable in time and space to be\nthe existence of things in themselves; it does not therefore oblige us\nto give up our capital supposition of the ideality of time as a mere\nform of sensible intuition, and consequently as a mere manner of\nrepresentation which is proper to the subject as belonging to the\nworld of sense; and therefore it only requires that this view be\nreconciled with this idea."

But the pain is quite legitimate, because when\nthe law of our intelligible [supersensible] existence (the moral\nlaw) is in question, reason recognizes no distinction of time, and\nonly asks whether the event belongs to me, as my act, and then\nalways morally connects the same feeling with it, whether it has\nhappened just now or long ago. For in reference to the supersensible\nconsciousness of its existence (i.e., freedom) the life of sense is\nbut a single phenomenon, which, inasmuch as it contains merely\nmanifestations of the mental disposition with regard to the moral\nlaw (i.e., of the character), must be judged not according to the\nphysical necessity that belongs to it as phenomenon, but according\nto the absolute spontaneity of freedom. It may therefore be admitted\nthat, if it were possible to have so profound an insight into a\nman's mental character as shown by internal as well as external\nactions as to know all its motives, even the smallest, and likewise\nall the external occasions that can influence them, we could calculate\na man's conduct for the future with as great certainty as a lunar or\nsolar eclipse; and nevertheless we may maintain that the man is\nfree. In fact, if we were capable of a further glance, namely, an\nintellectual intuition of the same subject (which indeed is not\ngranted to us, and instead of it we have only the rational concept),\nthen we should perceive that this whole chain of appearances in regard\nto all that concerns the moral laws depends on the spontaneity of\nthe subject as a thing in itself, of the determination of which no\nphysical explanation can be given.

In this view,\nwhich is natural to our reason, though inexplicable, we can also\njustify some judgements which we passed with all conscientiousness,\nand which yet at first sight seem quite opposed to all equity. There\nare cases in which men, even with the same education which has been\nprofitable to others, yet show such early depravity, and so continue\nto progress in it to years of manhood, that they are thought to be\nborn villains, and their character altogether incapable of\nimprovement; and nevertheless they are judged for what they do or\nleave undone, they are reproached for their faults as guilty; nay,\nthey themselves (the children) regard these reproaches as well\nfounded, exactly as if in spite of the hopeless natural quality of\nmind ascribed to them, they remained just as responsible as any\nother man.

For in reference to the supersensible\nconsciousness of its existence (i.e., freedom) the life of sense is\nbut a single phenomenon, which, inasmuch as it contains merely\nmanifestations of the mental disposition with regard to the moral\nlaw (i.e., of the character), must be judged not according to the\nphysical necessity that belongs to it as phenomenon, but according\nto the absolute spontaneity of freedom. It may therefore be admitted\nthat, if it were possible to have so profound an insight into a\nman's mental character as shown by internal as well as external\nactions as to know all its motives, even the smallest, and likewise\nall the external occasions that can influence them, we could calculate\na man's conduct for the future with as great certainty as a lunar or\nsolar eclipse; and nevertheless we may maintain that the man is\nfree. In fact, if we were capable of a further glance, namely, an\nintellectual intuition of the same subject (which indeed is not\ngranted to us, and instead of it we have only the rational concept),\nthen we should perceive that this whole chain of appearances in regard\nto all that concerns the moral laws depends on the spontaneity of\nthe subject as a thing in itself, of the determination of which no\nphysical explanation can be given. In default of this intuition, the\nmoral law assures us of this distinction between the relation of our\nactions as appearance to our sensible nature, and the relation of this\nsensible nature to the supersensible substratum in us. In this view,\nwhich is natural to our reason, though inexplicable, we can also\njustify some judgements which we passed with all conscientiousness,\nand which yet at first sight seem quite opposed to all equity. There\nare cases in which men, even with the same education which has been\nprofitable to others, yet show such early depravity, and so continue\nto progress in it to years of manhood, that they are thought to be\nborn villains, and their character altogether incapable of\nimprovement; and nevertheless they are judged for what they do or\nleave undone, they are reproached for their faults as guilty; nay,\nthey themselves (the children) regard these reproaches as well\nfounded, exactly as if in spite of the hopeless natural quality of\nmind ascribed to them, they remained just as responsible as any\nother man. This could not happen if we did not suppose that whatever\nsprings from a man's choice (as every action intentionally performed\nundoubtedly does) has as its foundation a free causality, which from\nearly youth expresses its character in its manifestations (i.e.,\nactions). These, on account of the uniformity of conduct, exhibit a\nnatural connection, which however does not make the vicious quality of\nthe will necessary, but on the contrary, is the consequence of the\nevil principles voluntarily adopted and unchangeable, which only\nmake it so much the more culpable and deserving of punishment. There\nstill remains a difficulty in the combination of freedom with the\nmechanism of nature in a being belonging to the world of sense; a\ndifficulty which, even after all the foregoing is admitted,\nthreatens freedom with complete destruction. But with this danger\nthere is also a circumstance that offers hope of an issue still\nfavourable to freedom; namely, that the same difficulty presses much\nmore strongly (in fact as we shall presently see, presses only) on the\nsystem that holds the existence determinable in time and space to be\nthe existence of things in themselves; it does not therefore oblige us\nto give up our capital supposition of the ideality of time as a mere\nform of sensible intuition, and consequently as a mere manner of\nrepresentation which is proper to the subject as belonging to the\nworld of sense; and therefore it only requires that this view be\nreconciled with this idea."

A man may use as much art as\nhe likes in order to paint to himself an unlawful act, that he\nremembers, as an unintentional error, a mere oversight, such as one\ncan never altogether avoid, and therefore as something in which he was\ncarried away by the stream of physical necessity, and thus to make\nhimself out innocent, yet he finds that the advocate who speaks in his\nfavour can by no means silence the accuser within, if only he is\nconscious that at the time when he did this wrong he was in his\nsenses, that is, in possession of his freedom; and, nevertheless, he\naccounts for his error from some bad habits, which by gradual\nneglect of attention he has allowed to grow upon him to such a\ndegree that he can regard his error as its natural consequence,\nalthough this cannot protect him from the blame and reproach which\nhe casts upon himself. This is also the ground of repentance for a\nlong past action at every recollection of it; a painful feeling\nproduced by the moral sentiment, and which is practically void in so\nfar as it cannot serve to undo what has been done. (Hence Priestley,\nas a true and consistent fatalist, declares it absurd, and he deserves\nto be commended for this candour more than those who, while they\nmaintain the mechanism of the will in fact, and its freedom in words\nonly, yet wish it to be thought that they include it in their system\nof compromise, although they do not explain the possibility of such\nmoral imputation.)

Therefore I do not see how those who still\ninsist on regarding time and space as attributes belonging to the\nexistence of things in themselves, can avoid admitting the fatality of\nactions; or if (like the otherwise acute Mendelssohn) they allow\nthem to be conditions necessarily belonging to the existence of finite\nand derived beings, but not to that of the infinite Supreme Being, I\ndo not see on what ground they can justify such a distinction, or,\nindeed, how they can avoid the contradiction that meets them, when\nthey hold that existence in time is an attribute necessarily belonging\nto finite things in themselves, whereas God is the cause of this\nexistence, but cannot be the cause of time (or space) itself (since\nthis must be presupposed as a necessary a priori condition of the\nexistence of things); and consequently as regards the existence of\nthese things. His causality must be subject to conditions and even\nto the condition of time; and this would inevitably bring in\neverything contradictory to the notions of His infinity and\nindependence. On the other hand, it is quite easy for us to draw the\ndistinction between the attribute of the divine existence of being\nindependent on all time-conditions, and that of a being of the world\nof sense, the distinction being that between the existence of a\nbeing in itself and that of a thing in appearance. Hence, if this\nideality of time and space is not adopted, nothing remains but\nSpinozism, in which space and time are essential attributes of the\nSupreme Being Himself, and the things dependent on Him (ourselves,\ntherefore, included) are not substances, but merely accidents inhering\nin Him; since, if these things as His effects exist in time only, this\nbeing the condition of their existence in themselves, then the actions\nof these beings must be simply His actions which He performs in some\nplace and time. Thus, Spinozism, in spite of the absurdity of its\nfundamental idea, argues more consistently than the creation theory\ncan, when beings assumed to be substances, and beings in themselves\nexisting in time, are regarded as effects of a Supreme Cause, and\nyet as not [belonging] to Him and His action, but as separate\nsubstances."

I presently find that as I cannot think\nanything without a category, I must first look for a category for the\nrational idea of freedom with which I am now concerned; and this is the\ncategory of causality; and although freedom, a concept of the reason,\nbeing a transcendent concept, cannot have any intuition corresponding to\nit, yet the concept of the understanding- for the synthesis of which the\nformer demands the unconditioned- (namely, the concept of causality)\nmust have a sensible intuition given, by which first its objective\nreality is assured.

Whence it resulted in the\nDialectic of Pure Theoretic Reason that the opposite methods of\nattaining the unconditioned and the totality of the conditions were both\nwrong. The categories of the second class (those of causality and of the\nnecessity of a thing) did not require this homogeneity (of the\nconditioned and the condition in synthesis), since here what we have to\nexplain is not how the intuition is compounded from a manifold in it,\nbut only how the existence of the conditioned object corresponding to it\nis added to the existence of the condition (added, namely, in the\nunderstanding as connected therewith); and in that case it was allowable\nto suppose in the supersensible world the unconditioned antecedent to\nthe altogether conditioned in the world of sense (both as regards the\ncausal connection and the contingent existence of things themselves),\nalthough this unconditioned remained indeterminate, and to make the\nsynthesis transcendent. Hence, it was found in the Dialectic of the Pure\nSpeculative Reason that the two apparently opposite methods of obtaining\nfor the conditioned the unconditioned were not really contradictory,\ne.g., in the synthesis of causality to conceive for the conditioned in\nthe series of causes and effects of the sensible world, a causality\nwhich has no sensible condition, and that the same action which, as\nbelonging to the world of sense, is always sensibly conditioned, that\nis, mechanically necessary, yet at the same time may be derived from a\ncausality not sensibly conditioned- being the causality of the acting\nbeing as belonging to the supersensible world- and may consequently be\nconceived as free. Now, the only point in question was to change this\nmay be into is; that is, that we should be able to show in an actual\ncase, as it were by a fact, that certain actions imply such a causality\n(namely, the intellectual, sensibly unconditioned), whether they are\nactual or only commanded, that is, objectively necessary in a practical\nsense. We could not hope to find this connexion in actions actually\ngiven in experience as events of the sensible world, since causality\nwith freedom must always be sought outside the world of sense in the\nworld of intelligence. But things of sense are the only things offered\nto our perception and observation. Hence, nothing remained but to find\nan incontestable objective principle of causality which excludes all\nsensible conditions: that is, a principle in which reason does not\nappeal further to something else as a determining ground of its\ncausality, but contains this determining ground itself by means of that\nprinciple, and in which therefore it is itself as pure reason practical.\nNow, this principle had not to be searched for or discovered; it had\nlong been in the reason of all men, and incorporated in their nature,\nand is the principle of morality. Therefore, that unconditioned\ncausality, with the faculty of it, namely, freedom, is no longer merely\nindefinitely and problematically thought (this speculative reason could\nprove to be feasible), but is even as regards the law of its causality\ndefinitely and assertorially known; and with it the fact that a being (I\nmyself), belonging to the world of sense, belongs also to the\nsupersensible world, this is also positively known, and thus the reality\nof the supersensible world is established and in practical respects\ndefinitely given, and this definiteness, which for theoretical purposes\nwould be transcendent, is for practical purposes immanent. We could not,\nhowever, make a similar step as regards the second dynamical idea,\nnamely, that of a necessary being.

On the other hand, it is now obvious that this\nconnection is quite possible in relation to our own subject, inasmuch as\nI know myself to be on the one side as an intelligible [supersensible]\nbeing determined by the moral law (by means of freedom), and on the\nother side as acting in the world of sense. It is the concept of freedom\nalone that enables us to find the unconditioned and intelligible for the\nconditioned and sensible without going out of ourselves. For it is our\nown reason that by means of the supreme and unconditional practical law\nknows that itself and the being that is conscious of this law (our own\nperson) belong to the pure world of understanding, and moreover defines\nthe manner in which, as such, it can be active. In this way it can be\nunderstood why in the whole faculty of reason it is the practical reason\nonly that can help us to pass beyond the world of sense and give us\nknowledge of a supersensible order and connection, which, however, for\nthis very reason cannot be extended further than is necessary for pure\npractical purposes."

I presently find that as I cannot think\nanything without a category, I must first look for a category for the\nrational idea of freedom with which I am now concerned; and this is the\ncategory of causality; and although freedom, a concept of the reason,\nbeing a transcendent concept, cannot have any intuition corresponding to\nit, yet the concept of the understanding- for the synthesis of which the\nformer demands the unconditioned- (namely, the concept of causality)\nmust have a sensible intuition given, by which first its objective\nreality is assured. Now, the categories are all divided into two\nclasses- the mathematical, which concern the unity of synthesis in the\nconception of objects, and the dynamical, which refer to the unity of\nsynthesis in the conception of the existence of objects. The former\n(those of magnitude and quality) always contain a synthesis of the\nhomogeneous, and it is not possible to find in this the unconditioned\nantecedent to what is given in sensible intuition as conditioned in\nspace and time, as this would itself have to belong to space and time,\nand therefore be again still conditioned. Whence it resulted in the\nDialectic of Pure Theoretic Reason that the opposite methods of\nattaining the unconditioned and the totality of the conditions were both\nwrong. The categories of the second class (those of causality and of the\nnecessity of a thing) did not require this homogeneity (of the\nconditioned and the condition in synthesis), since here what we have to\nexplain is not how the intuition is compounded from a manifold in it,\nbut only how the existence of the conditioned object corresponding to it\nis added to the existence of the condition (added, namely, in the\nunderstanding as connected therewith); and in that case it was allowable\nto suppose in the supersensible world the unconditioned antecedent to\nthe altogether conditioned in the world of sense (both as regards the\ncausal connection and the contingent existence of things themselves),\nalthough this unconditioned remained indeterminate, and to make the\nsynthesis transcendent. Hence, it was found in the Dialectic of the Pure\nSpeculative Reason that the two apparently opposite methods of obtaining\nfor the conditioned the unconditioned were not really contradictory,\ne.g., in the synthesis of causality to conceive for the conditioned in\nthe series of causes and effects of the sensible world, a causality\nwhich has no sensible condition, and that the same action which, as\nbelonging to the world of sense, is always sensibly conditioned, that\nis, mechanically necessary, yet at the same time may be derived from a\ncausality not sensibly conditioned- being the causality of the acting\nbeing as belonging to the supersensible world- and may consequently be\nconceived as free. Now, the only point in question was to change this\nmay be into is; that is, that we should be able to show in an actual\ncase, as it were by a fact, that certain actions imply such a causality\n(namely, the intellectual, sensibly unconditioned), whether they are\nactual or only commanded, that is, objectively necessary in a practical\nsense. We could not hope to find this connexion in actions actually\ngiven in experience as events of the sensible world, since causality\nwith freedom must always be sought outside the world of sense in the\nworld of intelligence. But things of sense are the only things offered\nto our perception and observation. Hence, nothing remained but to find\nan incontestable objective principle of causality which excludes all\nsensible conditions: that is, a principle in which reason does not\nappeal further to something else as a determining ground of its\ncausality, but contains this determining ground itself by means of that\nprinciple, and in which therefore it is itself as pure reason practical.\nNow, this principle had not to be searched for or discovered; it had\nlong been in the reason of all men, and incorporated in their nature,\nand is the principle of morality. Therefore, that unconditioned\ncausality, with the faculty of it, namely, freedom, is no longer merely\nindefinitely and problematically thought (this speculative reason could\nprove to be feasible), but is even as regards the law of its causality\ndefinitely and assertorially known; and with it the fact that a being (I\nmyself), belonging to the world of sense, belongs also to the\nsupersensible world, this is also positively known, and thus the reality\nof the supersensible world is established and in practical respects\ndefinitely given, and this definiteness, which for theoretical purposes\nwould be transcendent, is for practical purposes immanent.

Hence, nothing remained but to find\nan incontestable objective principle of causality which excludes all\nsensible conditions: that is, a principle in which reason does not\nappeal further to something else as a determining ground of its\ncausality, but contains this determining ground itself by means of that\nprinciple, and in which therefore it is itself as pure reason practical.\nNow, this principle had not to be searched for or discovered; it had\nlong been in the reason of all men, and incorporated in their nature,\nand is the principle of morality. Therefore, that unconditioned\ncausality, with the faculty of it, namely, freedom, is no longer merely\nindefinitely and problematically thought (this speculative reason could\nprove to be feasible), but is even as regards the law of its causality\ndefinitely and assertorially known; and with it the fact that a being (I\nmyself), belonging to the world of sense, belongs also to the\nsupersensible world, this is also positively known, and thus the reality\nof the supersensible world is established and in practical respects\ndefinitely given, and this definiteness, which for theoretical purposes\nwould be transcendent, is for practical purposes immanent. We could not,\nhowever, make a similar step as regards the second dynamical idea,\nnamely, that of a necessary being.

For if we\nattempted to do so, we should have ventured to leave at a bound all that\nis given to us, and to leap to that of which nothing is given us that\ncan help us to effect the connection of such a supersensible being with\nthe world of sense (since the necessary being would have to be known as\ngiven outside ourselves). On the other hand, it is now obvious that this\nconnection is quite possible in relation to our own subject, inasmuch as\nI know myself to be on the one side as an intelligible [supersensible]\nbeing determined by the moral law (by means of freedom), and on the\nother side as acting in the world of sense. It is the concept of freedom\nalone that enables us to find the unconditioned and intelligible for the\nconditioned and sensible without going out of ourselves.

In this way it can be\nunderstood why in the whole faculty of reason it is the practical reason\nonly that can help us to pass beyond the world of sense and give us\nknowledge of a supersensible order and connection, which, however, for\nthis very reason cannot be extended further than is necessary for pure\npractical purposes."

Now, the only point in question was to change this\nmay be into is; that is, that we should be able to show in an actual\ncase, as it were by a fact, that certain actions imply such a causality\n(namely, the intellectual, sensibly unconditioned), whether they are\nactual or only commanded, that is, objectively necessary in a practical\nsense.

Hence, it was found in the Dialectic of the Pure\nSpeculative Reason that the two apparently opposite methods of obtaining\nfor the conditioned the unconditioned were not really contradictory,\ne.g., in the synthesis of causality to conceive for the conditioned in\nthe series of causes and effects of the sensible world, a causality\nwhich has no sensible condition, and that the same action which, as\nbelonging to the world of sense, is always sensibly conditioned, that\nis, mechanically necessary, yet at the same time may be derived from a\ncausality not sensibly conditioned- being the causality of the acting\nbeing as belonging to the supersensible world- and may consequently be\nconceived as free. Now, the only point in question was to change this\nmay be into is; that is, that we should be able to show in an actual\ncase, as it were by a fact, that certain actions imply such a causality\n(namely, the intellectual, sensibly unconditioned), whether they are\nactual or only commanded, that is, objectively necessary in a practical\nsense. We could not hope to find this connexion in actions actually\ngiven in experience as events of the sensible world, since causality\nwith freedom must always be sought outside the world of sense in the\nworld of intelligence. But things of sense are the only things offered\nto our perception and observation. Hence, nothing remained but to find\nan incontestable objective principle of causality which excludes all\nsensible conditions: that is, a principle in which reason does not\nappeal further to something else as a determining ground of its\ncausality, but contains this determining ground itself by means of that\nprinciple, and in which therefore it is itself as pure reason practical.\nNow, this principle had not to be searched for or discovered; it had\nlong been in the reason of all men, and incorporated in their nature,\nand is the principle of morality. Therefore, that unconditioned\ncausality, with the faculty of it, namely, freedom, is no longer merely\nindefinitely and problematically thought (this speculative reason could\nprove to be feasible), but is even as regards the law of its causality\ndefinitely and assertorially known; and with it the fact that a being (I\nmyself), belonging to the world of sense, belongs also to the\nsupersensible world, this is also positively known, and thus the reality\nof the supersensible world is established and in practical respects\ndefinitely given, and this definiteness, which for theoretical purposes\nwould be transcendent, is for practical purposes immanent. We could not,\nhowever, make a similar step as regards the second dynamical idea,\nnamely, that of a necessary being. We could not rise to it from the\nsensible world without the aid of the first dynamical idea. For if we\nattempted to do so, we should have ventured to leave at a bound all that\nis given to us, and to leap to that of which nothing is given us that\ncan help us to effect the connection of such a supersensible being with\nthe world of sense (since the necessary being would have to be known as\ngiven outside ourselves). On the other hand, it is now obvious that this\nconnection is quite possible in relation to our own subject, inasmuch as\nI know myself to be on the one side as an intelligible [supersensible]\nbeing determined by the moral law (by means of freedom), and on the\nother side as acting in the world of sense. It is the concept of freedom\nalone that enables us to find the unconditioned and intelligible for the\nconditioned and sensible without going out of ourselves. For it is our\nown reason that by means of the supreme and unconditional practical law\nknows that itself and the being that is conscious of this law (our own\nperson) belong to the pure world of understanding, and moreover defines\nthe manner in which, as such, it can be active. In this way it can be\nunderstood why in the whole faculty of reason it is the practical reason\nonly that can help us to pass beyond the world of sense and give us\nknowledge of a supersensible order and connection, which, however, for\nthis very reason cannot be extended further than is necessary for pure\npractical purposes."

    "paragraph_content": "Since it is, properly speaking, the notion of freedom alone amongst all\nthe ideas of pure speculative reason that so greatly enlarges our\nknowledge in the sphere of the supersensible, though only of our\npractical knowledge, I ask myself why it exclusively possesses so great\nfertility, whereas the others only designate the vacant space for\npossible beings of the pure understanding, but are unable by any means\nto define the concept of them. I presently find that as I cannot think\nanything without a category, I must first look for a category for the\nrational idea of freedom with which I am now concerned; and this is the\ncategory of causality; and although freedom, a concept of the reason,\nbeing a transcendent concept, cannot have any intuition corresponding to\nit, yet the concept of the understanding- for the synthesis of which the\nformer demands the unconditioned- (namely, the concept of causality)\nmust have a sensible intuition given, by which first its objective\nreality is assured. Now, the categories are all divided into two\nclasses- the mathematical, which concern the unity of synthesis in the\nconception of objects, and the dynamical, which refer to the unity of\nsynthesis in the conception of the existence of objects. The former\n(those of magnitude and quality) always contain a synthesis of the\nhomogeneous, and it is not possible to find in this the unconditioned\nantecedent to what is given in sensible intuition as conditioned in\nspace and time, as this would itself have to belong to space and time,\nand therefore be again still conditioned. Whence it resulted in the\nDialectic of Pure Theoretic Reason that the opposite methods of\nattaining the unconditioned and the totality of the conditions were both\nwrong. The categories of the second class (those of causality and of the\nnecessity of a thing) did not require this homogeneity (of the\nconditioned and the condition in synthesis), since here what we have to\nexplain is not how the intuition is compounded from a manifold in it,\nbut only how the existence of the conditioned object corresponding to it\nis added to the existence of the condition (added, namely, in the\nunderstanding as connected therewith); and in that case it was allowable\nto suppose in the supersensible world the unconditioned antecedent to\nthe altogether conditioned in the world of sense (both as regards the\ncausal connection and the contingent existence of things themselves),\nalthough this unconditioned remained indeterminate, and to make the\nsynthesis transcendent.

This illusion would never be noticed as delusive if\nit did not betray itself by a conflict of reason with itself, when\nit applies to appearances its fundamental principle of presupposing\nthe unconditioned to everything conditioned. By this, however,\nreason is compelled to trace this illusion to its source, and search\nhow it can be removed, and this can only be done by a complete\ncritical examination of the whole pure faculty of reason; so that\nthe antinomy of the pure reason which is manifest in its dialectic\nis in fact the most beneficial error into which human reason could\never have fallen, since it at last drives us to search for the key\nto escape from this labyrinth; and when this key is found, it\nfurther discovers that which we did not seek but yet had need of,\nnamely, a view into a higher and an immutable order of things, in\nwhich we even now are, and in which we are thereby enabled by definite\nprecepts to continue to live according to the highest dictates of\nreason."

The first is\nabsolutely impossible, because (as was proved in the Analytic)\nmaxims which place the determining principle of the will in the desire\nof personal happiness are not moral at all, and no virtue can be\nfounded on them.

Yes this word is self-contentment which in\nits proper signification always designates only a negative\nsatisfaction in one's existence, in which one is conscious of\nneeding nothing. Freedom and the consciousness of it as a faculty of\nfollowing the moral law with unyielding resolution is independence\nof inclinations, at least as motives determining (though not as\naffecting) our desire, and so far as I am conscious of this freedom in\nfollowing my moral maxims, it is the only source of an unaltered\ncontentment which is necessarily connected with it and rests on no\nspecial feeling. This may be called intellectual contentment.

But if pure\nreason of itself can be practical and is actually so, as the\nconsciousness of the moral law proves, then it is still only one and\nthe same reason which, whether in a theoretical or a practical point\nof view, judges according to a priori principles; and then it is clear\nthat although it is in the first point of view incompetent to\nestablish certain propositions positively, which, however, do not\ncontradict it, then, as soon as these propositions are inseparably\nattached to the practical interest of pure reason, it must accept\nthem, though it be as something offered to it from a foreign source,\nsomething that has not grown on its own ground, but yet is\nsufficiently authenticated; and it must try to compare and connect\nthem with everything that it has in its power as speculative reason.\nIt must remember, however, that these are not additions to its\ninsight, but yet are extensions of its employment in another,\nnamely, a practical aspect; and this is not in the least opposed to\nits interest, which consists in the restriction of wild speculation."

The\nInfinite Being, to whom the condition of time is nothing, sees in this\nto us endless succession a whole of accordance with the moral law; and\nthe holiness which his command inexorably requires, in order to be\ntrue to his justice in the share which He assigns to each in the\nsummum bonum, is to be found in a single intellectual intuition of the\nwhole existence of rational beings. All that can be expected of the\ncreature in respect of the hope of this participation would be the\nconsciousness of his tried character, by which from the progress he\nhas hitherto made from the worse to the morally better, and the\nimmutability of purpose which has thus become known to him, he may\nhope for a further unbroken continuance of the same, however long\nhis existence may last, even beyond this life, * and thus he may\nhope, not indeed here, nor in any imaginable point of his future\nexistence, but only in the endlessness of his duration (which God\nalone can survey) to be perfectly adequate to his will (without\nindulgence or excuse, which do not harmonize with justice)."

It follows that the postulate of the possibility of the\nhighest derived good (the best world) is likewise the postulate of the\nreality of a highest original good, that is to say, of the existence\nof God.

The Epicureans had indeed assumed as the supreme\nprinciple of morality a wholly false one, namely that of happiness,\nand had substituted for a law a maxim of arbitrary choice according to\nevery man's inclination; they proceeded, however, consistently\nenough in this, that they degraded their summum bonum likewise, just\nin proportion to the meanness of their fundamental principle, and\nlooked for no greater happiness than can be attained by human prudence\n(including temperance and moderation of the inclinations), and this as\nwe know would be scanty enough and would be very different according\nto circumstances; not to mention the exceptions that their maxims must\nperpetually admit and which make them incapable of being laws. The\nStoics, on the contrary, had chosen their supreme practical\nprinciple quite rightly, making virtue the condition of the summum\nbonum; but when they represented the degree of virtue required by\nits pure law as fully attainable in this life, they not only\nstrained the moral powers of the man whom they called the wise\nbeyond all the limits of his nature, and assumed a thing that\ncontradicts all our knowledge of men, but also and principally they\nwould not allow the second element of the summum bonum, namely,\nhappiness, to be properly a special object of human desire, but made\ntheir wise man, like a divinity in his consciousness of the excellence\nof his person, wholly independent of nature (as regards his own\ncontentment); they exposed him indeed to the evils of life, but made\nhim not subject to them (at the same time representing him also as\nfree from moral evil).

The moral law is holy\n(unyielding) and demands holiness of morals, although all the moral\nperfection to which man can attain is still only virtue, that is, a\nrightful disposition arising from respect for the law, implying\nconsciousness of a constant propensity to transgression, or at least a\nwant of purity, that is, a mixture of many spurious (not moral)\nmotives of obedience to the law, consequently a self-esteem combined\nwith humility. In respect, then, of the holiness which the Christian\nlaw requires, this leaves the creature nothing but a progress in\ninfinitum, but for that very reason it justifies him in hoping for\nan endless duration of his existence. The worth of a character\nperfectly accordant with the moral law is infinite, since the only\nrestriction on all possible happiness in the judgement of a wise and\nall powerful distributor of it is the absence of conformity of\nrational beings to their duty. But the moral law of itself does not\npromise any happiness, for according to our conceptions of an order of\nnature in general, this is not necessarily connected with obedience to\nthe law. Now Christian morality supplies this defect (of the second\nindispensable element of the summum bonum) by representing the world\nin which rational beings devote themselves with all their soul to\nthe moral law, as a kingdom of God, in which nature and morality are\nbrought into a harmony foreign to each of itself, by a holy Author who\nmakes the derived summum bonum possible.

Nevertheless, the Christian principle of morality itself is\nnot theological (so as to be heteronomy), but is autonomy of pure\npractical reason, since it does not make the knowledge of God and\nHis will the foundation of these laws, but only of the attainment of\nthe summum bonum, on condition of following these laws, and it does\nnot even place the proper spring of this obedience in the desired\nresults, but solely in the conception of duty, as that of which the\nfaithful observance alone constitutes the worthiness to obtain those\nhappy consequences."

The\nStoic system made the consciousness of strength of mind the pivot on\nwhich all moral dispositions should turn; and although its disciples\nspoke of duties and even defined them very well, yet they placed the\nspring and proper determining principle of the will in an elevation of\nthe mind above the lower springs of the senses, which owe their\npower only to weakness of mind. With them therefore, virtue was a sort\nof heroism in the wise man raising himself above the animal nature\nof man, is sufficient for Himself, and, while he prescribes duties\nto others, is himself raised above them, and is not subject to any\ntemptation to transgress the moral law. All this, however, they\ncould not have done if they had conceived this law in all its purity\nand strictness, as the precept of the Gospel does. When I give the\nname idea to a perfection to which nothing adequate can be given in\nexperience, it does not follow that the moral ideas are thing\ntranscendent, that is something of which we could not even determine\nthe concept adequately, or of which it is uncertain whether there is\nany object corresponding to it at all, as is the case with the ideas\nof speculative reason; on the contrary, being types of practical\nperfection, they serve as the indispensable rule of conduct and\nlikewise as the standard of comparison. Now if I consider Christian\nmorals on their philosophical side, then compared with the ideas of\nthe Greek schools, they would appear as follows: the ideas of the\nCynics, the Epicureans, the Stoics, and the Christians are: simplicity\nof nature, prudence, wisdom, and holiness. In respect of the way of\nattaining them, the Greek schools were distinguished from one\nanother thus that the Cynics only required common sense, the others\nthe path of science, but both found the mere use of natural powers\nsufficient for the purpose. Christian morality, because its precept is\nframed (as a moral precept must be) so pure and unyielding, takes from\nman all confidence that he can be fully adequate to it, at least in\nthis life, but again sets it up by enabling us to hope that if we\nact as well as it is in our power to do, then what is not in our power\nwill come in to our aid from another source, whether we know how\nthis may be or not. Aristotle and Plato differed only as to the origin\nof our moral conceptions."

This, however,\nis not possible without presupposing three theoretical conceptions\n(for which, because they are mere conceptions of pure reason, no\ncorresponding intuition can be found, nor consequently by the path\nof theory any objective reality); namely, freedom, immortality, and\nGod. Thus by the practical law which commands the existence of the\nhighest good possible in a world, the possibility of those objects\nof pure speculative reason is postulated, and the objective reality\nwhich the latter could not assure them. By this the theoretical\nknowledge of pure reason does indeed obtain an accession; but it\nconsists only in this, that those concepts which otherwise it had to\nlook upon as problematical (merely thinkable) concepts, are now\nshown assertorially to be such as actually have objects; because\npractical reason indispensably requires their existence for the\npossibility of its object, the summum bonum, which practically is\nabsolutely necessary, and this justifies theoretical reason in\nassuming them. But this extension of theoretical reason is no\nextension of speculative, that is, we cannot make any positive use\nof it in a theoretical point of view. For as nothing is accomplished\nin this by practical reason, further than that these concepts are real\nand actually have their (possible) objects, and nothing in the way\nof intuition of them is given thereby (which indeed could not be\ndemanded), hence the admission of this reality does not render any\nsynthetical proposition possible. Consequently, this discovery does\nnot in the least help us to extend this knowledge of ours in a\nspeculative point of view, although it does in respect of the\npractical employment of pure reason. The above three ideas of\nspeculative reason are still in themselves not cognitions; they are\nhowever (transcendent) thoughts, in which there is nothing impossible.\nNow, by help of an apodeictic practical law, being necessary\nconditions of that which it commands to be made an object, they\nacquire objective reality; that is, we learn from it that they have\nobjects, without being able to point out how the conception of them is\nrelated to an object, and this, too, is still not a cognition of these\nobjects; for we cannot thereby form any synthetical judgement about\nthem, nor determine their application theoretically; consequently,\nwe can make no theoretical rational use of them at all, in which use\nall speculative knowledge of reason consists. Nevertheless, the\ntheoretical knowledge, not indeed of these objects, but of reason\ngenerally, is so far enlarged by this, that by the practical\npostulates objects were given to those ideas, a merely problematical\nthought having by this means first acquired objective reality. There\nis therefore no extension of the knowledge of given supersensible\nobjects, but an extension of theoretical reason and of its knowledge\nin respect of the supersensible generally; inasmuch as it is compelled\nto admit that there are such objects, although it is not able to\ndefine them more closely, so as itself to extend this knowledge of the\nobjects (which have now been given it on practical grounds, and only\nfor practical use). For this accession, then, pure theoretical reason,\nfor which all those ideas are transcendent and without object, has\nsimply to thank its practical faculty.

The above three ideas of\nspeculative reason are still in themselves not cognitions; they are\nhowever (transcendent) thoughts, in which there is nothing impossible.\nNow, by help of an apodeictic practical law, being necessary\nconditions of that which it commands to be made an object, they\nacquire objective reality; that is, we learn from it that they have\nobjects, without being able to point out how the conception of them is\nrelated to an object, and this, too, is still not a cognition of these\nobjects; for we cannot thereby form any synthetical judgement about\nthem, nor determine their application theoretically; consequently,\nwe can make no theoretical rational use of them at all, in which use\nall speculative knowledge of reason consists. Nevertheless, the\ntheoretical knowledge, not indeed of these objects, but of reason\ngenerally, is so far enlarged by this, that by the practical\npostulates objects were given to those ideas, a merely problematical\nthought having by this means first acquired objective reality. There\nis therefore no extension of the knowledge of given supersensible\nobjects, but an extension of theoretical reason and of its knowledge\nin respect of the supersensible generally; inasmuch as it is compelled\nto admit that there are such objects, although it is not able to\ndefine them more closely, so as itself to extend this knowledge of the\nobjects (which have now been given it on practical grounds, and only\nfor practical use). For this accession, then, pure theoretical reason,\nfor which all those ideas are transcendent and without object, has\nsimply to thank its practical faculty. In this they become immanent\nand constitutive, being the source of the possibility of realizing the\nnecessary object of pure practical reason (the summum bonum);\nwhereas apart from this they are transcendent, and merely regulative\nprinciples of speculative reason, which do not require it to assume\na new object beyond experience, but only to bring its use in\nexperience nearer to completeness. But when once reason is in\npossession of this accession, it will go to work with these ideas as\nspeculative reason (properly only to assure the certainty of its\npractical use) in a negative manner: that is, not extending but\nclearing up its knowledge so as on one side to keep off\nanthropomorphism, as the source of superstition, or seeming\nextension of these conceptions by supposed experience; and on the\nother side fanaticism, which promises the same by means of\nsupersensible intuition or feelings of the like kind. All these are\nhindrances to the practical use of pure reason, so that the removal of\nthem may certainly be considered an extension of our knowledge in a\npractical point of view, without contradicting the admission that\nfor speculative purposes reason has not in the least gained by this."

    "paragraph_content": "It cannot indeed be denied that in order to bring an uncultivated or\ndegraded mind into the track of moral goodness some preparatory\nguidance is necessary, to attract it by a view of its own advantage,\nor to alarm it by fear of loss; but as soon as this mechanical work,\nthese leading-strings have produced some effect, then we must bring\nbefore the mind the pure moral motive, which, not only because it is\nthe only one that can be the foundation of a character (a\npractically consistent habit of mind with unchangeable maxims), but\nalso because it teaches a man to feel his own dignity, gives the\nmind a power unexpected even by himself, to tear himself from all\nsensible attachments so far as they would fain have the rule, and to\nfind a rich compensation for the sacrifice he offers, in the\nindependence of his rational nature and the greatness of soul to which\nhe sees that he is destined. We will therefore show, by such\nobservations as every one can make, that this property of our minds,\nthis receptivity for a pure moral interest, and consequently the\nmoving force of the pure conception of virtue, when it is properly\napplied to the human heart, is the most powerful spring and, when a\ncontinued and punctual observance of moral maxims is in question,\nthe only spring of good conduct. It must, however, be remembered\nthat if these observations only prove the reality of such a feeling,\nbut do not show any moral improvement brought about by it, this is\nno argument against the only method that exists of making the\nobjectively practical laws of pure reason subjectively practical,\nthrough the mere force of the conception of duty; nor does it prove\nthat this method is a vain delusion. For as it has never yet come into\nvogue, experience can say nothing of its results; one can only ask for\nproofs of the receptivity for such springs, and these I will now\nbriefly present, and then sketch the method of founding and\ncultivating genuine moral dispositions."

Persons, to whom in other cases\nanything subtle and speculative in theoretical questions is dry and\nirksome, presently join in when the question is to make out the\nmoral import of a good or bad action that has been related, and they\ndisplay an exactness, a refinement, a subtlety, in excogitating\neverything that can lessen the purity of purpose, and consequently the\ndegree of virtue in it, which we do not expect from them in any\nother kind of speculation. In these criticisms, persons who are\npassing judgement on others often reveal their own character: some, in\nexercising their judicial office, especially upon the dead, seem\ninclined chiefly to defend the goodness that is related of this or\nthat deed against all injurious charges of insincerity, and ultimately\nto defend the whole moral worth of the person against the reproach\nof dissimulation and secret wickedness; others, on the contrary,\nturn their thoughts more upon attacking this worth by accusation and\nfault finding. We cannot always, however, attribute to these latter\nthe intention of arguing away virtue altogether out of all human\nexamples in order to make it an empty name; often, on the contrary, it\nis only well-meant strictness in determining the true moral import\nof actions according to an uncompromising law. Comparison with such\na law, instead of with examples, lowers self-conceit in moral\nmatters very much, and not merely teaches humility, but makes every\none feel it when he examines himself closely. Nevertheless, we can for\nthe most part observe, in those who defend the purity of purpose in\ngiving examples that where there is the presumption of uprightness\nthey are anxious to remove even the least spot, lest, if all\nexamples had their truthfulness disputed, and if the purity of all\nhuman virtue were denied, it might in the end be regarded as a mere\nphantom, and so all effort to attain it be made light of as vain\naffectation and delusive conceit."

Then to fill\nthe measure of suffering, and that he may feel the pain that only\nthe morally good heart can feel very deeply, let us conceive his\nfamily threatened with extreme distress and want, entreating him to\nyield; conceive himself, though upright, yet with feelings not hard or\ninsensible either to compassion or to his own distress; conceive\nhim, I say, at the moment when he wishes that he had never lived to\nsee the day that exposed him to such unutterable anguish, yet\nremaining true to his uprightness of purpose, without wavering or even\ndoubting; then will my youthful hearer be raised gradually from mere\napproval to admiration, from that to amazement, and finally to the\ngreatest veneration, and a lively wish that he himself could be such a\nman (though certainly not in such circumstances). Yet virtue is here\nworth so much only because it costs so much, not because it brings any\nprofit. All the admiration, and even the endeavour to resemble this\ncharacter, rest wholly on the purity of the moral principle, which can\nonly be strikingly shown by removing from the springs of action\neverything that men may regard as part of happiness. Morality, then,\nmust have the more power over the human heart the more purely it is\nexhibited. Whence it follows that, if the law of morality and the\nimage of holiness and virtue are to exercise any influence at all on\nour souls, they can do so only so far as they are laid to heart in\ntheir purity as motives, unmixed with any view to prosperity, for it\nis in suffering that they display themselves most nobly. Now that\nwhose removal strengthens the effect of a moving force must have\nbeen a hindrance, consequently every admixture of motives taken from\nour own happiness is a hindrance to the influence of the moral law\non the heart. I affirm further that even in that admired action, if\nthe motive from which it was done was a high regard for duty, then\nit is just this respect for the law that has the greatest influence on\nthe mind of the spectator, not any pretension to a supposed inward\ngreatness of mind or noble meritorious sentiments; consequently\nduty, not merit, must have not only the most definite, but, when it is\nrepresented in the true light of its inviolability, the most\npenetrating, influence on the mind."

Now, however, the second exercise comes in, the\nliving exhibition of morality of character by examples, in which\nattention is directed to purity of will, first only as a negative\nperfection, in so far as in an action done from duty no motives of\ninclination have any influence in determining it. By this the\npupil's attention is fixed upon the consciousness of his freedom,\nand although this renunciation at first excites a feeling of pain,\nnevertheless, by its withdrawing the pupil from the constraint of even\nreal wants, there is proclaimed to him at the same time a\ndeliverance from the manifold dissatisfaction in which all these wants\nentangle him, and the mind is made capable of receiving the\nsensation of satisfaction from other sources.

And now the law of duty, in consequence of the\npositive worth which obedience to it makes us feel, finds easier\naccess through the respect for ourselves in the consciousness of our\nfreedom. When this is well established, when a man dreads nothing more\nthan to find himself, on self-examination, worthless and\ncontemptible in his own eyes, then every good moral disposition can be\ngrafted on it, because this is the best, nay, the only guard that\ncan keep off from the mind the pressure of ignoble and corrupting\nmotives."

    "paragraph_content": "This example may suggest to us to enter on the same path in treating\nof the moral capacities of our nature, and may give us hope of a\nlike good result. We have at hand the instances of the moral judgement\nof reason. By analysing these into their elementary conceptions, and\nin default of mathematics adopting a process similar to that of\nchemistry, the separation of the empirical from the rational\nelements that may be found in them, by repeated experiments on\ncommon sense, we may exhibit both pure, and learn with certainty\nwhat each part can accomplish of itself, so as to prevent on the one\nhand the errors of a still crude untrained judgement, and on the other\nhand (what is far more necessary) the extravagances of genius, by\nwhich, as by the adepts of the philosopher's stone, without any\nmethodical study or knowledge of nature, visionary treasures are\npromised and the true are thrown away. In one word, science\n(critically undertaken and methodically directed) is the narrow gate\nthat leads to the true doctrine of practical wisdom, if we\nunderstand by this not merely what one ought to do, but what ought\nto serve teachers as a guide to construct well and clearly the road to\nwisdom which everyone should travel, and to secure others from going\nastray. Philosophy must always continue to be the guardian of this\nscience; and although the public does not take any interest in its\nsubtle investigations, it must take an interest in the resulting\ndoctrines, which such an examination first puts in a clear light."
