Whether therefore the productive\nfaculty of nature is sufficient for that which we judge to be formed\nor combined in accordance with the Idea of purposes, as well as\nfor that which we believe to require merely a mechanical system\n[Maschinenwesen] of nature; or whether there lies at the basis of\nthings which we must necessarily judge as properly natural purposes,\na quite different kind of original causality, which cannot be\ncontained in material nature or in its intelligible substrate, viz. an\narchitectonic Understanding--this is a question to which our Reason,\nvery narrowly limited in respect of the concept of causality if it\nis to be specified _a priori_, can give no answer whatever.--But it\nis just as certain and beyond doubt that, in regard to our cognitive\nfaculties, the mere mechanism of nature can furnish no ground of\nexplanation of the production of organised beings. _For the reflective\nJudgement_ it is therefore a quite correct fundamental proposition,\nthat for that connexion of things according to final causes which is\nso plain, there must be thought a causality distinct from that of\nmechanism, viz. that of an (intelligent) cause of the world acting in\naccordance with purposes; but _for the determinant Judgement_ this\nwould be a hasty and unprovable proposition.

In case the will of a rational being is pathologically\naffected, there may occur a conflict of the maxims with the\npractical laws recognized by itself. For example, one may make it\nhis maxim to let no injury pass unrevenged, and yet he may see that\nthis is not a practical law, but only his own maxim; that, on the\ncontrary, regarded as being in one and the same maxim a rule for the\nwill of every rational being, it must contradict itself. In natural\nphilosophy the principles of what happens, (e.g., the principle of\nequality of action and reaction in the communication of motion) are at\nthe same time laws of nature; for the use of reason there is\ntheoretical and determined by the nature of the object. In practical\nphilosophy, i.e., that which has to do only with the grounds of\ndetermination of the will, the principles which a man makes for\nhimself are not laws by which one is inevitably bound; because\nreason in practical matters has to do with the subject, namely, with\nthe faculty of desire, the special character of which may occasion\nvariety in the rule. The practical rule is always a product of reason,\nbecause it prescribes action as a means to the effect. But in the case\nof a being with whom reason does not of itself determine the will,\nthis rule is an imperative, i.e., a rule characterized by \"shall,\"\nwhich expresses the objective necessitation of the action and\nsignifies that, if reason completely determined the will, the action\nwould inevitably take place according to this rule. Imperatives,\ntherefore, are objectively valid, and are quite distinct from\nmaxims, which are subjective principles. The former either determine\nthe conditions of the causality of the rational being as an\nefficient cause, i.e., merely in reference to the effect and the means\nof attaining it; or they determine the will only, whether it is\nadequate to the effect or not. The former would be hypothetical\nimperatives, and contain mere precepts of skill; the latter, on the\ncontrary, would be categorical, and would alone be practical laws.\nThus maxims are principles, but not imperatives. Imperatives\nthemselves, however, when they are conditional (i.e., do not determine\nthe will simply as will, but only in respect to a desired effect, that\nis, when they are hypothetical imperatives), are practical precepts\nbut not laws. Laws must be sufficient to determine the will as will,\neven before I ask whether I have power sufficient for a desired\neffect, or the means necessary to produce it; hence they are\ncategorical: otherwise they are not laws at all, because the necessity\nis wanting, which, if it is to be practical, must be independent of\nconditions which are pathological and are therefore only\ncontingently connected with the will. Tell a man, for example, that he\nmust be industrious and thrifty in youth, in order that he may not\nwant in old age; this is a correct and important practical precept\nof the will. But it is easy to see that in this case the will is\ndirected to something else which it is presupposed that it desires;\nand as to this desire, we must leave it to the actor himself whether\nhe looks forward to other resources than those of his own acquisition,\nor does not expect to be old, or thinks that in case of future\nnecessity he will be able to make shift with little. Reason, from\nwhich alone can spring a rule involving necessity, does, indeed,\ngive necessity to this precept (else it would not be an imperative),\nbut this is a necessity dependent on subjective conditions, and cannot\nbe supposed in the same degree in all subjects. But that reason may\ngive laws it is necessary that it should only need to presuppose\nitself, because rules are objectively and universally valid only\nwhen they hold without any contingent subjective conditions, which\ndistinguish one rational being from another. Now tell a man that he\nshould never make a deceitful promise, this is a rule which only\nconcerns his will, whether the purposes he may have can be attained\nthereby or not; it is the volition only which is to be determined a\npriori by that rule. If now it is found that this rule is\npractically right, then it is a law, because it is a categorical\nimperative. Thus, practical laws refer to the will only, without\nconsidering what is attained by its causality, and we may disregard\nthis latter (as belonging to the world of sense) in order to have them\nquite pure.",

Yet we\nare, through reason, conscious of a law to which all our maxims are\nsubject, as though a natural order must be originated from our will.\nThis law, therefore, must be the idea of a natural system not given in\nexperience, and yet possible through freedom; a system, therefore,\nwhich is supersensible, and to which we give objective reality, at\nleast in a practical point of view, since we look on it as an object\nof our will as pure rational beings.",

In practical\nphilosophy, i.e., that which has to do only with the grounds of\ndetermination of the will, the principles which a man makes for\nhimself are not laws by which one is inevitably bound; because\nreason in practical matters has to do with the subject, namely, with\nthe faculty of desire, the special character of which may occasion\nvariety in the rule. The practical rule is always a product of reason,\nbecause it prescribes action as a means to the effect. But in the case\nof a being with whom reason does not of itself determine the will,\nthis rule is an imperative, i.e., a rule characterized by \"shall,\"\nwhich expresses the objective necessitation of the action and\nsignifies that, if reason completely determined the will, the action\nwould inevitably take place according to this rule. Imperatives,\ntherefore, are objectively valid, and are quite distinct from\nmaxims, which are subjective principles. The former either determine\nthe conditions of the causality of the rational being as an\nefficient cause, i.e., merely in reference to the effect and the means\nof attaining it; or they determine the will only, whether it is\nadequate to the effect or not. The former would be hypothetical\nimperatives, and contain mere precepts of skill; the latter, on the\ncontrary, would be categorical, and would alone be practical laws.\nThus maxims are principles, but not imperatives. Imperatives\nthemselves, however, when they are conditional (i.e., do not determine\nthe will simply as will, but only in respect to a desired effect, that\nis, when they are hypothetical imperatives), are practical precepts\nbut not laws. Laws must be sufficient to determine the will as will,\neven before I ask whether I have power sufficient for a desired\neffect, or the means necessary to produce it; hence they are\ncategorical: otherwise they are not laws at all, because the necessity\nis wanting, which, if it is to be practical, must be independent of\nconditions which are pathological and are therefore only\ncontingently connected with the will. Tell a man, for example, that he\nmust be industrious and thrifty in youth, in order that he may not\nwant in old age; this is a correct and important practical precept\nof the will. But it is easy to see that in this case the will is\ndirected to something else which it is presupposed that it desires;\nand as to this desire, we must leave it to the actor himself whether\nhe looks forward to other resources than those of his own acquisition,\nor does not expect to be old, or thinks that in case of future\nnecessity he will be able to make shift with little. Reason, from\nwhich alone can spring a rule involving necessity, does, indeed,\ngive necessity to this precept (else it would not be an imperative),\nbut this is a necessity dependent on subjective conditions, and cannot\nbe supposed in the same degree in all subjects. But that reason may\ngive laws it is necessary that it should only need to presuppose\nitself, because rules are objectively and universally valid only\nwhen they hold without any contingent subjective conditions, which\ndistinguish one rational being from another. Now tell a man that he\nshould never make a deceitful promise, this is a rule which only\nconcerns his will, whether the purposes he may have can be attained\nthereby or not; it is the volition only which is to be determined a\npriori by that rule. If now it is found that this rule is\npractically right, then it is a law, because it is a categorical\nimperative. Thus, practical laws refer to the will only, without\nconsidering what is attained by its causality, and we may disregard\nthis latter (as belonging to the world of sense) in order to have them\nquite pure.",

Without repeating what has been said above, I will here\nonly remark the fallacy they fall into. In order to imagine the\nvicious man as tormented with mental dissatisfaction by the\nconsciousness of his transgressions, they must first represent him\nas in the main basis of his character, at least in some degree,\nmorally good; just as he who is pleased with the consciousness of\nright conduct must be conceived as already virtuous.

A man must first\nappreciate the importance of what we call duty, the authority of the\nmoral law, and the immediate dignity which the following of it gives\nto the person in his own eyes, in order to feel that satisfaction in\nthe consciousness of his conformity to it and the bitter remorse\nthat accompanies the consciousness of its transgression. It is,\ntherefore, impossible to feel this satisfaction or dissatisfaction\nprior to the knowledge of obligation, or to make it the basis of the\nlatter. A man must be at least half honest in order even to be able to\nform a conception of these feelings.

Without repeating what has been said above, I will here\nonly remark the fallacy they fall into. In order to imagine the\nvicious man as tormented with mental dissatisfaction by the\nconsciousness of his transgressions, they must first represent him\nas in the main basis of his character, at least in some degree,\nmorally good; just as he who is pleased with the consciousness of\nright conduct must be conceived as already virtuous. The notion of\nmorality and duty must, therefore, have preceded any regard to this\nsatisfaction, and cannot be derived from it. A man must first\nappreciate the importance of what we call duty, the authority of the\nmoral law, and the immediate dignity which the following of it gives\nto the person in his own eyes, in order to feel that satisfaction in\nthe consciousness of his conformity to it and the bitter remorse\nthat accompanies the consciousness of its transgression. It is,\ntherefore, impossible to feel this satisfaction or dissatisfaction\nprior to the knowledge of obligation, or to make it the basis of the\nlatter. A man must be at least half honest in order even to be able to\nform a conception of these feelings. I do not deny that as the human\nwill is, by virtue of liberty, capable of being immediately determined\nby the moral law, so frequent practice in accordance with this\nprinciple of determination can, at least, produce subjectively a\nfeeling of satisfaction; on the contrary, it is a duty to establish\nand to cultivate this, which alone deserves to be called properly\nthe moral feeling; but the notion of duty cannot be derived from it,\nelse we should have to suppose a feeling for the law as such, and thus\nmake that an object of sensation which can only be thought by the\nreason; and this, if it is not to be a flat contradiction, would\ndestroy all notion of duty and put in its place a mere mechanical play\nof refined inclinations sometimes contending with the coarser.",

Now, if every crime, even without regarding the\nphysical consequence with respect to the actor, is in itself\npunishable, that is, forfeits happiness (at least partially), it is\nobviously absurd to say that the crime consisted just in this, that he\nhas drawn punishment on himself, thereby injuring his private\nhappiness (which, on the principle of self-love, must be the proper\nnotion of all crime). According to this view, the punishment would\nbe the reason for calling anything a crime, and justice would, on\nthe contrary, consist in omitting all punishment, and even\npreventing that which naturally follows; for, if this were done, there\nwould no longer be any evil in the action, since the harm which\notherwise followed it, and on account of which alone the action was\ncalled evil, would now be prevented. To look, however, on all\nrewards and punishments as merely the machinery in the hand of a\nhigher power, which is to serve only to set rational creatures\nstriving after their final end (happiness), this is to reduce the will\nto a mechanism destructive of freedom; this is so evident that it need\nnot detain us.",

We see that the external behaviour of other men is similar to our\nown, and that the most reasonable way of accounting for such behaviour\nis to suppose that they have minds like ourselves, that they are\npossessed of an active and spontaneously energising faculty, which is\nthe seat of their personality. But it is instructive to observe that\nneither on Kantian principles nor on any other can we _demonstrate_\nthis; to cross the chasm which separates one man’s personality from\nanother’s requires a venture of faith just as emphatically as any\ntheological formula. I can by no means _prove_ to the determinant\nJudgement that the complex of sensations which I constantly experience,\nand which I call the Prime Minister, is anything more than a\nwell-ordered machine. It is improbable that this is the case--highly\nimprobable; but the falsity of such an hypothesis cannot be proved in\nthe same way that we would prove the falsity of the assertion that two\nand two make five. But then though the hypothesis cannot be thus ruled\nout of court by demonstration of its absurdity, it is not the simplest\nhypothesis, nor is it that one which best accounts for the facts. The\nassumption, on the other hand, that the men whom I meet every day have\nminds like my own, perfectly accounts for all the facts, and is a very\nsimple assumption. It merely extends by induction the sphere of a force\nwhich I already know to exist. Or in other words, crude materialism not\ngiving me an intelligent account of my own individual consciousness,\nI recognise mind, νοῦς, as a _vera causa_, as something which really\ndoes produce effects in the field of experience, and which therefore I\nmay legitimately put forward as the cause of those actions of other\nmen which externally so much resemble my own. But, as has been said\nbefore, this argument, though entirely convincing to any sane person,\nis not demonstrative; in Kantian language and on Kantian principles\nthe reasoning here used would seem to be valid only for the reflective\nand not for the determinant Judgement. If the principle of design or\nconscious adaptation of means to ends be not a constitutive principle\nof experience, but only a regulative principle introduced to account\nfor the facts, what right have we to put it forward dogmatically as\naffording an explanation of the actions of other human beings?",

This is also the ground of repentance for a\nlong past action at every recollection of it; a painful feeling\nproduced by the moral sentiment, and which is practically void in so\nfar as it cannot serve to undo what has been done. (Hence Priestley,\nas a true and consistent fatalist, declares it absurd, and he deserves\nto be commended for this candour more than those who, while they\nmaintain the mechanism of the will in fact, and its freedom in words\nonly, yet wish it to be thought that they include it in their system\nof compromise, although they do not explain the possibility of such\nmoral imputation.)

For in reference to the supersensible\nconsciousness of its existence (i.e., freedom) the life of sense is\nbut a single phenomenon, which, inasmuch as it contains merely\nmanifestations of the mental disposition with regard to the moral\nlaw (i.e., of the character), must be judged not according to the\nphysical necessity that belongs to it as phenomenon, but according\nto the absolute spontaneity of freedom. It may therefore be admitted\nthat, if it were possible to have so profound an insight into a\nman's mental character as shown by internal as well as external\nactions as to know all its motives, even the smallest, and likewise\nall the external occasions that can influence them, we could calculate\na man's conduct for the future with as great certainty as a lunar or\nsolar eclipse; and nevertheless we may maintain that the man is\nfree. In fact, if we were capable of a further glance, namely, an\nintellectual intuition of the same subject (which indeed is not\ngranted to us, and instead of it we have only the rational concept),\nthen we should perceive that this whole chain of appearances in regard\nto all that concerns the moral laws depends on the spontaneity of\nthe subject as a thing in itself, of the determination of which no\nphysical explanation can be given. In default of this intuition, the\nmoral law assures us of this distinction between the relation of our\nactions as appearance to our sensible nature, and the relation of this\nsensible nature to the supersensible substratum in us. In this view,\nwhich is natural to our reason, though inexplicable, we can also\njustify some judgements which we passed with all conscientiousness,\nand which yet at first sight seem quite opposed to all equity. There\nare cases in which men, even with the same education which has been\nprofitable to others, yet show such early depravity, and so continue\nto progress in it to years of manhood, that they are thought to be\nborn villains, and their character altogether incapable of\nimprovement; and nevertheless they are judged for what they do or\nleave undone, they are reproached for their faults as guilty; nay,\nthey themselves (the children) regard these reproaches as well\nfounded, exactly as if in spite of the hopeless natural quality of\nmind ascribed to them, they remained just as responsible as any\nother man. This could not happen if we did not suppose that whatever\nsprings from a man's choice (as every action intentionally performed\nundoubtedly does) has as its foundation a free causality, which from\nearly youth expresses its character in its manifestations (i.e.,\nactions). These, on account of the uniformity of conduct, exhibit a\nnatural connection, which however does not make the vicious quality of\nthe will necessary, but on the contrary, is the consequence of the\nevil principles voluntarily adopted and unchangeable, which only\nmake it so much the more culpable and deserving of punishment. There\nstill remains a difficulty in the combination of freedom with the\nmechanism of nature in a being belonging to the world of sense; a\ndifficulty which, even after all the foregoing is admitted,\nthreatens freedom with complete destruction. But with this danger\nthere is also a circumstance that offers hope of an issue still\nfavourable to freedom; namely, that the same difficulty presses much\nmore strongly (in fact as we shall presently see, presses only) on the\nsystem that holds the existence determinable in time and space to be\nthe existence of things in themselves; it does not therefore oblige us\nto give up our capital supposition of the ideality of time as a mere\nform of sensible intuition, and consequently as a mere manner of\nrepresentation which is proper to the subject as belonging to the\nworld of sense; and therefore it only requires that this view be\nreconciled with this idea.",

            "content": "The difficulty is as follows: Even if it is admitted that the\nsupersensible subject can be free with respect to a given action,\nalthough, as a subject also belonging to the world of sense, he is\nunder mechanical conditions with respect to the same action, still, as\nsoon as we allow that God as universal first cause is also the cause\nof the existence of substance (a proposition which can never be\ngiven up without at the same time giving up the notion of God as the\nBeing of all beings, and therewith giving up his all sufficiency, on\nwhich everything in theology depends), it seems as if we must admit\nthat a man's actions have their determining principle in something\nwhich is wholly out of his power- namely, in the causality of a\nSupreme Being distinct from himself and on whom his own existence\nand the whole determination of his causality are absolutely dependent.\nIn point of fact, if a man's actions as belonging to his modifications\nin time were not merely modifications of him as appearance, but as a\nthing in itself, freedom could not be saved. Man would be a marionette\nor an automaton, like Vaucanson's, prepared and wound up by the\nSupreme Artist. Self-consciousness would indeed make him a thinking\nautomaton; but the consciousness of his own spontaneity would be\nmere delusion if this were mistaken for freedom, and it would\ndeserve this name only in a comparative sense, since, although the\nproximate determining causes of its motion and a long series of\ntheir determining causes are internal, yet the last and highest is\nfound in a foreign hand. Therefore I do not see how those who still\ninsist on regarding time and space as attributes belonging to the\nexistence of things in themselves, can avoid admitting the fatality of\nactions; or if (like the otherwise acute Mendelssohn) they allow\nthem to be conditions necessarily belonging to the existence of finite\nand derived beings, but not to that of the infinite Supreme Being, I\ndo not see on what ground they can justify such a distinction, or,\nindeed, how they can avoid the contradiction that meets them, when\nthey hold that existence in time is an attribute necessarily belonging\nto finite things in themselves, whereas God is the cause of this\nexistence, but cannot be the cause of time (or space) itself (since\nthis must be presupposed as a necessary a priori condition of the\nexistence of things); and consequently as regards the existence of\nthese things. His causality must be subject to conditions and even\nto the condition of time; and this would inevitably bring in\neverything contradictory to the notions of His infinity and\nindependence. On the other hand, it is quite easy for us to draw the\ndistinction between the attribute of the divine existence of being\nindependent on all time-conditions, and that of a being of the world\nof sense, the distinction being that between the existence of a\nbeing in itself and that of a thing in appearance. Hence, if this\nideality of time and space is not adopted, nothing remains but\nSpinozism, in which space and time are essential attributes of the\nSupreme Being Himself, and the things dependent on Him (ourselves,\ntherefore, included) are not substances, but merely accidents inhering\nin Him; since, if these things as His effects exist in time only, this\nbeing the condition of their existence in themselves, then the actions\nof these beings must be simply His actions which He performs in some\nplace and time. Thus, Spinozism, in spite of the absurdity of its\nfundamental idea, argues more consistently than the creation theory\ncan, when beings assumed to be substances, and beings in themselves\nexisting in time, are regarded as effects of a Supreme Cause, and\nyet as not [belonging] to Him and His action, but as separate\nsubstances.",

We see that the external behaviour of other men is similar to our\nown, and that the most reasonable way of accounting for such behaviour\nis to suppose that they have minds like ourselves, that they are\npossessed of an active and spontaneously energising faculty, which is\nthe seat of their personality. But it is instructive to observe that\nneither on Kantian principles nor on any other can we _demonstrate_\nthis; to cross the chasm which separates one man’s personality from\nanother’s requires a venture of faith just as emphatically as any\ntheological formula.

But, as has been said\nbefore, this argument, though entirely convincing to any sane person,\nis not demonstrative; in Kantian language and on Kantian principles\nthe reasoning here used would seem to be valid only for the reflective\nand not for the determinant Judgement.

        "source_text": "With this agree perfectly the judicial sentences of that wonderful\nfaculty in us which we call conscience. A man may use as much art as\nhe likes in order to paint to himself an unlawful act, that he\nremembers, as an unintentional error, a mere oversight, such as one\ncan never altogether avoid, and therefore as something in which he was\ncarried away by the stream of physical necessity, and thus to make\nhimself out innocent, yet he finds that the advocate who speaks in his\nfavour can by no means silence the accuser within, if only he is\nconscious that at the time when he did this wrong he was in his\nsenses, that is, in possession of his freedom; and, nevertheless, he\naccounts for his error from some bad habits, which by gradual\nneglect of attention he has allowed to grow upon him to such a\ndegree that he can regard his error as its natural consequence,\nalthough this cannot protect him from the blame and reproach which\nhe casts upon himself. This is also the ground of repentance for a\nlong past action at every recollection of it; a painful feeling\nproduced by the moral sentiment, and which is practically void in so\nfar as it cannot serve to undo what has been done. (Hence Priestley,\nas a true and consistent fatalist, declares it absurd, and he deserves\nto be commended for this candour more than those who, while they\nmaintain the mechanism of the will in fact, and its freedom in words\nonly, yet wish it to be thought that they include it in their system\nof compromise, although they do not explain the possibility of such\nmoral imputation.) But the pain is quite legitimate, because when\nthe law of our intelligible [supersensible] existence (the moral\nlaw) is in question, reason recognizes no distinction of time, and\nonly asks whether the event belongs to me, as my act, and then\nalways morally connects the same feeling with it, whether it has\nhappened just now or long ago. For in reference to the supersensible\nconsciousness of its existence (i.e., freedom) the life of sense is\nbut a single phenomenon, which, inasmuch as it contains merely\nmanifestations of the mental disposition with regard to the moral\nlaw (i.e., of the character), must be judged not according to the\nphysical necessity that belongs to it as phenomenon, but according\nto the absolute spontaneity of freedom. It may therefore be admitted\nthat, if it were possible to have so profound an insight into a\nman's mental character as shown by internal as well as external\nactions as to know all its motives, even the smallest, and likewise\nall the external occasions that can influence them, we could calculate\na man's conduct for the future with as great certainty as a lunar or\nsolar eclipse; and nevertheless we may maintain that the man is\nfree. In fact, if we were capable of a further glance, namely, an\nintellectual intuition of the same subject (which indeed is not\ngranted to us, and instead of it we have only the rational concept),\nthen we should perceive that this whole chain of appearances in regard\nto all that concerns the moral laws depends on the spontaneity of\nthe subject as a thing in itself, of the determination of which no\nphysical explanation can be given. In default of this intuition, the\nmoral law assures us of this distinction between the relation of our\nactions as appearance to our sensible nature, and the relation of this\nsensible nature to the supersensible substratum in us. In this view,\nwhich is natural to our reason, though inexplicable, we can also\njustify some judgements which we passed with all conscientiousness,\nand which yet at first sight seem quite opposed to all equity. There\nare cases in which men, even with the same education which has been\nprofitable to others, yet show such early depravity, and so continue\nto progress in it to years of manhood, that they are thought to be\nborn villains, and their character altogether incapable of\nimprovement; and nevertheless they are judged for what they do or\nleave undone, they are reproached for their faults as guilty; nay,\nthey themselves (the children) regard these reproaches as well\nfounded, exactly as if in spite of the hopeless natural quality of\nmind ascribed to them, they remained just as responsible as any\nother man. This could not happen if we did not suppose that whatever\nsprings from a man's choice (as every action intentionally performed\nundoubtedly does) has as its foundation a free causality, which from\nearly youth expresses its character in its manifestations (i.e.,\nactions). These, on account of the uniformity of conduct, exhibit a\nnatural connection, which however does not make the vicious quality of\nthe will necessary, but on the contrary, is the consequence of the\nevil principles voluntarily adopted and unchangeable, which only\nmake it so much the more culpable and deserving of punishment. There\nstill remains a difficulty in the combination of freedom with the\nmechanism of nature in a being belonging to the world of sense; a\ndifficulty which, even after all the foregoing is admitted,\nthreatens freedom with complete destruction. But with this danger\nthere is also a circumstance that offers hope of an issue still\nfavourable to freedom; namely, that the same difficulty presses much\nmore strongly (in fact as we shall presently see, presses only) on the\nsystem that holds the existence determinable in time and space to be\nthe existence of things in themselves; it does not therefore oblige us\nto give up our capital supposition of the ideality of time as a mere\nform of sensible intuition, and consequently as a mere manner of\nrepresentation which is proper to the subject as belonging to the\nworld of sense; and therefore it only requires that this view be\nreconciled with this idea.",

Without repeating what has been said above, I will here\nonly remark the fallacy they fall into. In order to imagine the\nvicious man as tormented with mental dissatisfaction by the\nconsciousness of his transgressions, they must first represent him\nas in the main basis of his character, at least in some degree,\nmorally good; just as he who is pleased with the consciousness of\nright conduct must be conceived as already virtuous. The notion of\nmorality and duty must, therefore, have preceded any regard to this\nsatisfaction, and cannot be derived from it. A man must first\nappreciate the importance of what we call duty, the authority of the\nmoral law, and the immediate dignity which the following of it gives\nto the person in his own eyes, in order to feel that satisfaction in\nthe consciousness of his conformity to it and the bitter remorse\nthat accompanies the consciousness of its transgression. It is,\ntherefore, impossible to feel this satisfaction or dissatisfaction\nprior to the knowledge of obligation, or to make it the basis of the\nlatter. A man must be at least half honest in order even to be able to\nform a conception of these feelings. I do not deny that as the human\nwill is, by virtue of liberty, capable of being immediately determined\nby the moral law, so frequent practice in accordance with this\nprinciple of determination can, at least, produce subjectively a\nfeeling of satisfaction; on the contrary, it is a duty to establish\nand to cultivate this, which alone deserves to be called properly\nthe moral feeling; but the notion of duty cannot be derived from it,\nelse we should have to suppose a feeling for the law as such, and thus\nmake that an object of sensation which can only be thought by the\nreason; and this, if it is not to be a flat contradiction, would\ndestroy all notion of duty and put in its place a mere mechanical play\nof refined inclinations sometimes contending with the coarser.",

The disjunctive judgement\ncontains, therefore, the relation of the parts of the whole sphere of a\ncognition, since the sphere of each part is a complemental part of the\nsphere of the other, each contributing to form the sum total of the\ndivided cognition. Take, for example, the proposition, “The world\nexists either through blind chance, or through internal necessity, or\nthrough an external cause.” Each of these propositions embraces a part\nof the sphere of our possible cognition as to the existence of a world;\nall of them taken together, the whole sphere. To take the cognition out\nof one of these spheres, is equivalent to placing it in one of the\nothers; and, on the other hand, to place it in one sphere is equivalent\nto taking it out of the rest.

In like manner, in transcendental logic, infinite must be\ndistinguished from affirmative judgements, although in general logic\nthey are rightly enough classed under affirmative. General logic\nabstracts all content of the predicate (though it be negative), and\nonly considers whether the said predicate be affirmed or denied of the\nsubject. But transcendental logic considers also the worth or content\nof this logical affirmation—an affirmation by means of a merely\nnegative predicate, and inquires how much the sum total of our\ncognition gains by this affirmation. For example, if I say of the soul,\n“It is not mortal”—by this negative judgement I should at least ward\noff error. Now, by the proposition, “The soul is not mortal,” I have,\nin respect of the logical form, really affirmed, inasmuch as I thereby\nplace the soul in the unlimited sphere of immortal beings. Now, because\nof the whole sphere of possible existences, the mortal occupies one\npart, and the immortal the other, neither more nor less is affirmed by\nthe proposition than that the soul is one among the infinite multitude\nof things which remain over, when I take away the whole mortal part.\nBut by this proceeding we accomplish only this much, that the infinite\nsphere of all possible existences is in so far limited that the mortal\nis excluded from it, and the soul is placed in the remaining part of\nthe extent of this sphere. But this part remains, notwithstanding this\nexception, infinite, and more and more parts may be taken away from the\nwhole sphere, without in the slightest degree thereby augmenting or\naffirmatively determining our conception of the soul. These judgements,\ntherefore, infinite in respect of their logical extent, are, in respect\nof the content of their cognition, merely limitative; and are\nconsequently entitled to a place in our transcendental table of all the\nmomenta of thought in judgements, because the function of the\nunderstanding exercised by them may perhaps be of importance in the\nfield of its pure à priori cognition.",

The modality of judgements is a quite peculiar function, with this\ndistinguishing characteristic, that it contributes nothing to the\ncontent of a judgement (for besides quantity, quality, and relation,\nthere is nothing more that constitutes the content of a judgement), but\nconcerns itself only with the value of the copula in relation to\nthought in general. Problematical judgements are those in which the\naffirmation or negation is accepted as merely possible (ad libitum). In\nthe assertorical, we regard the proposition as real (true); in the\napodeictical, we look on it as necessary.[13] Thus the two judgements\n(antecedens et consequens), the relation of which constitutes a\nhypothetical judgement, likewise those (the members of the division) in\nwhose reciprocity the disjunctive consists, are only problematical. In\nthe example above given the proposition, “There exists perfect\njustice,” is not stated assertorically, but as an ad libitum judgement,\nwhich someone may choose to adopt, and the consequence alone is\nassertorical. Hence such judgements may be obviously false, and yet,\ntaken problematically, be conditions of our cognition of the truth.\nThus the proposition, “The world exists only by blind chance,” is in\nthe disjunctive judgement of problematical import only: that is to say,\none may accept it for the moment, and it helps us (like the indication\nof the wrong road among all the roads that one can take) to find out\nthe true proposition. The problematical proposition is, therefore, that\nwhich expresses only logical possibility (which is not objective); that\nis, it expresses a free choice to admit the validity of such a\nproposition—a merely arbitrary reception of it into the understanding.\nThe assertorical speaks of logical reality or truth; as, for example,\nin a hypothetical syllogism, the antecedens presents itself in a\nproblematical form in the major, in an assertorical form in the minor,\nand it shows that the proposition is in harmony with the laws of the\nunderstanding. The apodeictical proposition cogitates the assertorical\nas determined by these very laws of the understanding, consequently as\naffirming à priori, and in this manner it expresses logical necessity.\nNow because all is here gradually incorporated with the\nunderstanding—inasmuch as in the first place we judge problematically;\nthen accept assertorically our judgement as true; lastly, affirm it as\ninseparably united with the understanding, that is, as necessary and\napodeictical—we may safely reckon these three functions of modality as\nso many momenta of thought.",

Now the\nmoral law as a law of freedom commands by determining principles,\nwhich ought to be quite independent of nature and of its harmony\nwith our faculty of desire (as springs). But the acting rational being\nin the world is not the cause of the world and of nature itself. There\nis not the least ground, therefore, in the moral law for a necessary\nconnection between morality and proportionate happiness in a being\nthat belongs to the world as part of it, and therefore dependent on\nit, and which for that reason cannot by his will be a cause of this\nnature, nor by his own power make it thoroughly harmonize, as far as\nhis happiness is concerned, with his practical principles.\nNevertheless, in the practical problem of pure reason, i.e., the\nnecessary pursuit of the summum bonum, such a connection is postulated\nas necessary: we ought to endeavour to promote the summum bonum,\nwhich, therefore, must be possible. Accordingly, the existence of a\ncause of all nature, distinct from nature itself and containing the\nprinciple of this connection, namely, of the exact harmony of\nhappiness with morality, is also postulated.

Therefore, the summum bonum is possible in the world only\non the supposition of a Supreme Being having a causality corresponding\nto moral character. Now a being that is capable of acting on the\nconception of laws is an intelligence (a rational being), and the\ncausality of such a being according to this conception of laws is\nhis will; therefore the supreme cause of nature, which must be\npresupposed as a condition of the summum bonum is a being which is the\ncause of nature by intelligence and will, consequently its author,\nthat is God. It follows that the postulate of the possibility of the\nhighest derived good (the best world) is likewise the postulate of the\nreality of a highest original good, that is to say, of the existence\nof God. Now it was seen to be a duty for us to promote the summum\nbonum; consequently it is not merely allowable, but it is a\nnecessity connected with duty as a requisite, that we should\npresuppose the possibility of this summum bonum; and as this is\npossible only on condition of the existence of God, it inseparably\nconnects the supposition of this with duty; that is, it is morally\nnecessary to assume the existence of God.",

            "content": "More refined, though equally false, is the theory of those who\nsuppose a certain special moral sense, which sense and not reason\ndetermines the moral law, and in consequence of which the\nconsciousness of virtue is supposed to be directly connected with\ncontentment and pleasure; that of vice, with mental dissatisfaction\nand pain; thus reducing the whole to the desire of private\nhappiness. Without repeating what has been said above, I will here\nonly remark the fallacy they fall into. In order to imagine the\nvicious man as tormented with mental dissatisfaction by the\nconsciousness of his transgressions, they must first represent him\nas in the main basis of his character, at least in some degree,\nmorally good; just as he who is pleased with the consciousness of\nright conduct must be conceived as already virtuous. The notion of\nmorality and duty must, therefore, have preceded any regard to this\nsatisfaction, and cannot be derived from it. A man must first\nappreciate the importance of what we call duty, the authority of the\nmoral law, and the immediate dignity which the following of it gives\nto the person in his own eyes, in order to feel that satisfaction in\nthe consciousness of his conformity to it and the bitter remorse\nthat accompanies the consciousness of its transgression. It is,\ntherefore, impossible to feel this satisfaction or dissatisfaction\nprior to the knowledge of obligation, or to make it the basis of the\nlatter. A man must be at least half honest in order even to be able to\nform a conception of these feelings. I do not deny that as the human\nwill is, by virtue of liberty, capable of being immediately determined\nby the moral law, so frequent practice in accordance with this\nprinciple of determination can, at least, produce subjectively a\nfeeling of satisfaction; on the contrary, it is a duty to establish\nand to cultivate this, which alone deserves to be called properly\nthe moral feeling; but the notion of duty cannot be derived from it,\nelse we should have to suppose a feeling for the law as such, and thus\nmake that an object of sensation which can only be thought by the\nreason; and this, if it is not to be a flat contradiction, would\ndestroy all notion of duty and put in its place a mere mechanical play\nof refined inclinations sometimes contending with the coarser.",

        "source_text": "3. All relations of thought in judgements are those (a) of the\npredicate to the subject; (b) of the principle to its consequence; (c)\nof the divided cognition and all the members of the division to each\nother. In the first of these three classes, we consider only two\nconceptions; in the second, two judgements; in the third, several\njudgements in relation to each other. The hypothetical proposition, “If\nperfect justice exists, the obstinately wicked are punished,” contains\nproperly the relation to each other of two propositions, namely,\n“Perfect justice exists,” and “The obstinately wicked are punished.”\nWhether these propositions are in themselves true is a question not\nhere decided. Nothing is cogitated by means of this judgement except a\ncertain consequence. Finally, the disjunctive judgement contains a\nrelation of two or more propositions to each other—a relation not of\nconsequence, but of logical opposition, in so far as the sphere of the\none proposition excludes that of the other. But it contains at the same\ntime a relation of community, in so far as all the propositions taken\ntogether fill up the sphere of the cognition. The disjunctive judgement\ncontains, therefore, the relation of the parts of the whole sphere of a\ncognition, since the sphere of each part is a complemental part of the\nsphere of the other, each contributing to form the sum total of the\ndivided cognition. Take, for example, the proposition, “The world\nexists either through blind chance, or through internal necessity, or\nthrough an external cause.” Each of these propositions embraces a part\nof the sphere of our possible cognition as to the existence of a world;\nall of them taken together, the whole sphere. To take the cognition out\nof one of these spheres, is equivalent to placing it in one of the\nothers; and, on the other hand, to place it in one sphere is equivalent\nto taking it out of the rest. There is, therefore, in a disjunctive\njudgement a certain community of cognitions, which consists in this,\nthat they mutually exclude each other, yet thereby determine, as a\nwhole, the true cognition, inasmuch as, taken together, they make up\nthe complete content of a particular given cognition. And this is all\nthat I find necessary, for the sake of what follows, to remark in this\nplace.",

But the\nformer notion, namely, that of perfection, may either be taken in a\ntheoretic signification, and then it means nothing but the\ncompleteness of each thing in its own kind (transcendental), or that\nof a thing merely as a thing (metaphysical); and with that we are\nnot concerned here. But the notion of perfection in a practical\nsense is the fitness or sufficiency of a thing for all sorts of\npurposes. This perfection, as a quality of man and consequently\ninternal, is nothing but talent and, what strengthens or completes\nthis, skill. Supreme perfection conceived as substance, that is God,\nand consequently external (considered practically), is the sufficiency\nof this being for all ends. Ends then must first be given,\nrelatively to which only can the notion of perfection (whether\ninternal in ourselves or external in God) be the determining principle\nof the will. But an end- being an object which must precede the\ndetermination of the will by a practical rule and contain the ground\nof the possibility of this determination, and therefore contain also\nthe matter of the will, taken as its determining principle- such an\nend is always empirical and, therefore, may serve for the Epicurean\nprinciple of the happiness theory, but not for the pure rational\nprinciple of morality and duty. Thus, talents and the improvement of\nthem, because they contribute to the advantages of life; or the will\nof God, if agreement with it be taken as the object of the will,\nwithout any antecedent independent practical principle, can be motives\nonly by reason of the happiness expected therefrom. Hence it\nfollows, first, that all the principles here stated are material;\nsecondly, that they include all possible material principles; and,\nfinally, the conclusion, that since material principles are quite\nincapable of furnishing the supreme moral law (as has been shown), the\nformal practical principle of the pure reason (according to which the\nmere form of a universal legislation must constitute the supreme and\nimmediate determining principle of the will) is the only one\npossible which is adequate to furnish categorical imperatives, that\nis, practical laws (which make actions a duty), and in general to\nserve as the principle of morality, both in criticizing conduct and\nalso in its application to the human will to determine it.",
