# RAG score calculation formula:
# rag_score = Σ(strategy_weight[i] * philosopher_rag_stat[i])
# 
# Example:
# When Nietzsche selects "Framing Shift" strategy:
# rag_score = (0.2 * 0.2) + (0.5 * 0.3) + (0.3 * 0.4) + (0.1 * 0.3) + (-0.3 * 0.9)
#           = 0.04 + 0.15 + 0.12 + 0.03 - 0.27 = 0.07 (Low score → No RAG usage)
#
# When Kant selects "Conceptual Undermining" strategy:
# rag_score = (0.1 * 0.6) + (0.6 * 0.9) + (0.3 * 0.9) + (0.05 * 0.2) + (-0.2 * 0.1)
#           = 0.06 + 0.54 + 0.27 + 0.01 - 0.02 = 0.86 (High score → RAG usage)

# Threshold settings (recommended)
rag_threshold:
  use_rag: 0.3      # Use RAG if score is above this value
  strong_rag: 0.6   # Strong RAG usage if score is above this value (more searches)
  
# Weight design principles:
# 1. data_respect: Values external evidence → High in Clipping, Temporal Delay
# 2. conceptual_precision: Conceptual accuracy → High in Conceptual Undermining, Framing Shift  
# 3. systematic_logic: Systematic logic → High in Reductive Paradox, Philosophical Reframing
# 4. pragmatic_orientation: Practical approach → High in Ethical Reversal, Clipping
# 5. rhetorical_independence: Intuitive tendency → Negative weight in all strategies (higher = less RAG usage)
