  "context": "\n디지털 프라이버시는 개인 정보가 온라인에서 어떻게 수집, 사용, 공유되는지에 관한 개념입니다.\n\n인터넷, 모바일 기기, IoT 기술의 확산으로 개인 데이터의 양과 종류가 기하급수적으로 증가했습니다.\n이 데이터는 기업과 정부에 의해 다양한 목적으로 활용됩니다.\n\n기업들은 개인화된 서비스 제공, 마케팅, 제품 개발 등에 데이터를 활용하여 경제적 가치를 창출합니다.\n동시에 정부는 국가 안보, 범죄 예방, 사회 서비스 향상 등을 위해 데이터를 수집하고 분석합니다.\n\n그러나 이러한 데이터 활용은 개인의 프라이버시 침해 우려를 낳고 있습니다.\n무분별한 데이터 수집, 동의 없는 정보 공유, 데이터 유출 사고 등이 지속적으로 발생하고 있습니다.\n\n주요 프라이버시 문제로는 행동 추적, 얼굴 인식 기술의 남용, 개인 정보의 상업적 거래,\n데이터 보안 취약점, 빅데이터 분석을 통한 프로파일링 등이 있습니다.\n\n이에 대응하여 GDPR(유럽), CCPA(캘리포니아) 등 각국에서 데이터 보호 규제를 강화하고 있으며,\n프라이버시 중심 설계(Privacy by Design)와 같은 접근법도 주목받고 있습니다.\n\n향후 디지털 프라이버시는 기술 혁신과 개인정보 보호 사이의 균형을 찾는 방향으로 발전할 것으로 전망됩니다.\n중요한 것은 개인의 데이터 주권을 보장하면서도 데이터의 사회적, 경제적 가치를 활용할 수 있는 방안을 마련하는 것입니다.\n",

Like, are we talking about ultimate freedom, or is it more like being stuck in a virtual office 24/7? \n\nAlright, let me introduce our awesome participants. On the pro side, we've got 찬성측 참가자, who’s all about championing remote work as the future of productivity and work-life balance. And on the con side, we have 반대측 참가자, who's ready to argue that traditional office work is irreplaceable for collaboration and innovation.\n\nSo, here's the deal: 찬성 입장 believes remote work offers flexibility, reduces commute stress, and can boost morale and efficiency. On the flip side, 반대 입장 argues that face-to-face interactions drive creativity and that remote work can lead to isolation and blurred boundaries between home and work life.\n\nAlright, with that set up, let's jump right in. 찬성측 참가자, why don't you kick things off for us?",
