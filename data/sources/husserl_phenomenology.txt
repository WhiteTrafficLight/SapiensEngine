EXCERPTS FROM EDMUND HUSSERL'S PHENOMENOLOGY

ON THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL METHOD:
Phenomenology invites us to set aside our preconceptions about the world and return "to the things themselves" as they appear directly to consciousness. This "bracketing" of assumptions, which I call the phenomenological epoché, allows us to examine the essential structures of consciousness and experience without being misled by unexamined presuppositions about reality.

ON INTENTIONALITY:
The fundamental property of consciousness is intentionality—that is, consciousness is always consciousness of something. Every mental act (perceiving, remembering, imagining, etc.) is directed toward an object. When I perceive a tree, my perception is directed toward the tree; when I remember a melody, my remembering is directed toward that melody. There is no consciousness without this directedness.

ON THE LIFE-WORLD (LEBENSWELT):
Beneath the abstractions of science and theory lies the life-world—the world as immediately experienced in pre-theoretical, pre-scientific awareness. This is the world of our everyday lives, rich with meaning and value. Scientific theories ultimately derive their meaning from this pre-reflective life-world, which they often conceal rather than reveal.

ON PHENOMENOLOGICAL REDUCTION:
Through phenomenological reduction, I suspend judgment about the existence of the external world to focus on the essential structures of experience. This is not a denial of the world's existence but a methodological stepping back from our natural attitude, in which we take the world's existence for granted. The reduction reveals consciousness as constituting meaning.

ON TIME-CONSCIOUSNESS:
Our experience of time has a complex structure. Each "now" moment contains retentions of what has just passed and protentions anticipating what is about to come. This temporal horizon gives experience its coherence. Even a simple melody is not experienced as isolated notes but as a meaningful whole extended in time through this retention-protention structure.

ON INTERSUBJECTIVITY:
Though phenomenology begins with the examination of one's own consciousness, it necessarily leads to the recognition of other consciousnesses. I experience others not as mere objects but as other subjects with their own streams of consciousness. This intersubjectivity is fundamental to the constitution of an objective world shared by multiple subjects.

ON THE TRANSCENDENTAL EGO:
Through phenomenological reduction, we discover the transcendental ego—the pure consciousness that constitutes meaning. This is not the empirical ego or personality, but the fundamental structure that makes experience possible. It is not a substance or entity within the world but the condition for the world's appearance.

ON THE CRISIS OF EUROPEAN SCIENCES:
Modern science, by mathematizing nature, has increasingly abstracted from the life-world. This has led to a crisis where science, while technically successful, has lost touch with the human meaning of its enterprise. The scientistic worldview treats nature as merely quantifiable, overlooking the qualitative dimensions of human experience.

ON PHENOMENOLOGY AND TRUTH:
Phenomenological truth is not correspondence between propositions and an independent reality, but evident givenness to consciousness. Truth is disclosed when phenomena show themselves as they are. Different types of objects give themselves with different modes of evidence appropriate to their essence.

ON THE TASK OF PHILOSOPHY:
Philosophy must become a rigorous science—not by imitating the natural sciences, but by grounding itself in the evidence of immediate experience. Its task is to clarify the essential structures of consciousness and its intentional correlates, thereby providing a foundation for all knowledge claims, including those of the positive sciences.
